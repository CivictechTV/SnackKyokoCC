1
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:16,000
I think it's time for you to come in.

2
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,633
welcome (in shops, etc.)

3
01:00:18,633 --> 01:00:21,166
Welcome to Snack Kyoko.

4
01:00:21,166 --> 01:00:22,599
Finally.

5
01:00:22,599 --> 01:00:26,033
I'm here.

6
01:00:26,033 --> 01:00:30,133
It'll be like opening a snack bar before you know it.

7
01:00:30,133 --> 01:00:32,666
I'm gonna have to wear that mask.

8
01:00:32,666 --> 01:00:34,099
Just so you know, this is how it's done.

9
01:00:34,099 --> 01:00:36,033
Acrylic sheets are used for splash protection.

10
01:00:36,033 --> 01:00:38,866
There's a big one right here.

11
01:00:38,866 --> 01:00:39,966
Yes, if you don't mind.

12
01:00:39,966 --> 01:00:41,766
Could you take off that mask for me?

13
01:00:41,766 --> 01:00:45,800
I'd like to talk to you.

14
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,599
What would you like to drink?

15
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:51,233
Highball, please!

16
01:00:51,233 --> 01:00:53,566
You're welcome, Mom.

17
01:00:53,566 --> 01:00:54,900
Thank you very much.

18
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:57,900
My mom also gave it to me.

19
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:00,000
Mom, I think we got it.

20
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,733
Can www.

21
01:01:04,733 --> 01:01:07,599
Yes, it's the same thing, isn't it?

22
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:10,099
Yes, thank you.

23
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:11,800
Okay.

24
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:12,466
That's right.

25
01:01:12,466 --> 01:01:14,366
That's very neat.

26
01:01:14,366 --> 01:01:15,133
Sounds good.

27
01:01:15,133 --> 01:01:15,966
It's cool.

28
01:01:15,966 --> 01:01:17,866
This is also to match the colors of that Code for Japan.

29
01:01:17,866 --> 01:01:18,833
Red dress.

30
01:01:18,833 --> 01:01:21,466
Oh, yes. Thank you.

31
01:01:21,466 --> 01:01:23,599
Thank you for your concern.

32
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:25,733
I tried to match them a little.

33
01:01:25,733 --> 01:01:28,066
I don't really talk about work.

34
01:01:28,066 --> 01:01:30,166
It's all about the community.

35
01:01:30,166 --> 01:01:32,466
Or a geo-media community.

36
01:01:32,466 --> 01:01:35,166
I wonder how much is in the open source community and so on.

37
01:01:35,166 --> 01:01:38,733
I think I've known him for about 10 years.

38
01:01:38,733 --> 01:01:41,199
I don't know if I've ever talked to you before.

39
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:43,699
I think I know who knows, maybe.

40
01:01:43,699 --> 01:01:45,966
But now, in terms of titles.

41
01:01:45,966 --> 01:01:49,199
Mr. Seki, President of Code for Japan

42
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:50,699
And Georepublic.

43
01:01:50,699 --> 01:01:52,900
I run a geomedia systems company.

44
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,266
I don't know if it's representative.

45
01:01:54,266 --> 01:01:57,666
That's a great image to have.

46
01:01:57,666 --> 01:01:59,166
From the beginning, because I already have.

47
01:01:59,166 --> 01:02:03,300
For example, after school, or after you start working.

48
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:06,533
You've been doing that kind of thing for a long time?

49
01:02:06,533 --> 01:02:09,333
I'm not really sure what to say.

50
01:02:09,333 --> 01:02:12,466
I'm just a regular businessman.

51
01:02:12,466 --> 01:02:15,066
I don't feel that way at all, though.

52
01:02:15,066 --> 01:02:18,233
I'm not interested in social issues at all.

53
01:02:18,233 --> 01:02:19,300
Oh, yeah.

54
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:24,699
I was already so unserious that I dropped out of college.

55
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:26,566
I think I'm going to write something about social issues for my thesis.

56
01:02:26,566 --> 01:02:29,566
No, not at all.

57
01:02:29,566 --> 01:02:31,000
I was in a band.

58
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,733
Oh, right, right, right.

59
01:02:33,733 --> 01:02:37,533
At first, I had a strong image of that.

60
01:02:37,533 --> 01:02:39,766
That's right.

61
01:02:39,766 --> 01:02:41,133
Well, then why is it that, with your history...

62
01:02:41,133 --> 01:02:43,833
Thank you very much.

63
01:02:43,833 --> 01:02:45,266
And a couple of snacks.

64
01:02:45,266 --> 01:02:48,766
I was wondering if Seki-san likes sweets today.

65
01:02:48,766 --> 01:02:52,099
I've been drinking a little.

66
01:02:52,099 --> 01:02:56,866
A little bit of sweet chocolate.

67
01:02:56,866 --> 01:02:58,033
I just found it.

68
01:02:58,033 --> 01:02:58,966
Oh, something about a snack Kyoko.

69
01:02:58,966 --> 01:03:02,099
He said that the selection of those snacks was bad.

70
01:03:02,099 --> 01:03:04,833
A lot the first time.

71
01:03:04,833 --> 01:03:08,066
Um, today's one might be hard to eat there, too.

72
01:03:08,066 --> 01:03:10,166
If you think about it.

73
01:03:10,166 --> 01:03:12,199
You know, the kind that looks like raw chocolate?

74
01:03:12,199 --> 01:03:15,300
Maybe I'll get cocoa on my teeth.

75
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:18,566
It's like he's talking with it on all the time.

76
01:03:18,566 --> 01:03:20,900
Have them eat clean.

77
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:21,666
Yes, sir.

78
01:03:21,666 --> 01:03:24,099
It might be a little big, but...

79
01:03:24,099 --> 01:03:26,300
It's also a bit like a beer.

80
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:27,566
It's true. Beer.

81
01:03:27,566 --> 01:03:28,033
That's right.

82
01:03:28,033 --> 01:03:28,699
I don't know.

83
01:03:28,699 --> 01:03:30,466
It has beer kneaded into it.

84
01:03:30,466 --> 01:03:30,900
Heh.

85
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:32,766
I found something like that.

86
01:03:32,766 --> 01:03:33,833
yes

87
01:03:33,833 --> 01:03:34,366
certainly

88
01:03:34,366 --> 01:03:36,166
Thank you very much.

89
01:03:36,166 --> 01:03:39,533
Cheers again.

90
01:03:39,533 --> 01:03:45,233
Welcome to Snack Kyoko.

91
01:03:45,233 --> 01:03:48,099
It's not like we drink like this.

92
01:03:48,099 --> 01:03:51,866
Oh, no, not at all.

93
01:03:51,866 --> 01:03:53,833
Well, I don't have a chance.

94
01:03:53,833 --> 01:03:57,133
I don't know if it's possible to have a drink with Seki-san.

95
01:03:57,133 --> 01:04:02,133
At the launch of an event or something.

96
01:04:02,133 --> 01:04:05,833
I've been in groups with other people.

97
01:04:05,833 --> 01:04:08,400
Most of them weren't there.

98
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:13,833
Launching in the first place, not staying that long.

99
01:04:13,833 --> 01:04:16,933
If you join, you're gone or something.

100
01:04:16,933 --> 01:04:18,500
Or something like that.

101
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:21,166
I'm not much of a drinker.

102
01:04:21,166 --> 01:04:22,666
Maybe after an event or something.

103
01:04:22,666 --> 01:04:24,566
But they're together.

104
01:04:24,566 --> 01:04:26,800
I've also come to Tokyo from Kansai.

105
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,766
I had to go home early again.

106
01:04:28,766 --> 01:04:30,500
Maybe not so much.

107
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,099
So today is really a bit unusual.

108
01:04:32,099 --> 01:04:33,199
I'm glad.

109
01:04:33,199 --> 01:04:34,366
I know, right?

110
01:04:34,366 --> 01:04:36,033
So I'd really like to do something like this.

111
01:04:36,033 --> 01:04:38,033
In what way?

112
01:04:38,033 --> 01:04:39,366
I mean, work.

113
01:04:39,366 --> 01:04:44,333
That's exactly the kind of social issue we're dealing with now.

114
01:04:44,333 --> 01:04:46,466
I don't know, until I get there.

115
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:50,800
Since I was in a band.

116
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,000
Well, I've already got a job.

117
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,533
I really have a dozen or so.

118
01:04:54,533 --> 01:04:56,366
It would take too long to say it all.

119
01:04:56,366 --> 01:04:56,966
You know, basically.

120
01:04:56,966 --> 01:04:58,699
I've been an engineer all my life.

121
01:04:58,699 --> 01:05:00,433
I like the band.

122
01:05:00,433 --> 01:05:04,433
That time is the most important for the band to be able to

123
01:05:04,433 --> 01:05:07,199
Occupations that allow you to go home early

124
01:05:07,199 --> 01:05:08,400
I'm choosing to be an engineer.

125
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,066
It just so happens that it is.

126
01:05:09,066 --> 01:05:11,933
coinciding with that boom in the Internet.

127
01:05:11,933 --> 01:05:13,866
Something about internet media.

128
01:05:13,866 --> 01:05:16,766
It's like a sports portal site.

129
01:05:16,766 --> 01:05:19,166
It's called Sportsnavi, or something like that.

130
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:22,599
There were ringtones in the music business back then.

131
01:05:22,599 --> 01:05:24,400
I'll be streaming music on that mobile.

132
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:25,566
That kind of thing.

133
01:05:25,566 --> 01:05:26,966
Or doing it.

134
01:05:26,966 --> 01:05:29,266
And then there's the ad-serving company.

135
01:05:29,266 --> 01:05:32,500
This company is called Sirius Technologies.

136
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:36,966
That's where a location-based ad delivery system like

137
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:38,466
I thought this was really interesting.

138
01:05:38,466 --> 01:05:43,900
I didn't have a smart phone back then.

139
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:44,666
even if it's a traditional Japanese phone (e.g. cell phone)

140
01:05:44,666 --> 01:05:47,166
The GPS is always installed.

141
01:05:47,166 --> 01:05:49,400
All kinds of services are starting to appear.

142
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,400
This is some amazing internet.

143
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,733
I thought I'd make it more interesting.

144
01:05:53,733 --> 01:05:55,766
So, you see...

145
01:05:55,766 --> 01:05:59,266
I wanted to join a company that was involved in location-based information.

146
01:05:59,266 --> 01:06:02,066
The first time I went in for that interview in a proper way.

147
01:06:02,066 --> 01:06:03,233
That's the company.

148
01:06:03,233 --> 01:06:04,300
And all the time before that.

149
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:06,033
I had a referral from someone I knew or something.

150
01:06:06,033 --> 01:06:10,566
It's true, it's kind of goofy.

151
01:06:10,566 --> 01:06:13,800
It's my first start as an engineer.

152
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,533
Because it is now.

153
01:06:15,533 --> 01:06:18,133
I was using that GPS back then.

154
01:06:18,133 --> 01:06:20,633
Internet advertising...

155
01:06:20,633 --> 01:06:21,633
I don't know, maybe now.

156
01:06:21,633 --> 01:06:23,166
Normal.

157
01:06:23,166 --> 01:06:24,266
I mean, the Internet.

158
01:06:24,266 --> 01:06:26,933
It's kind of normal for a web engineer.

159
01:06:26,933 --> 01:06:30,066
I don't know, at that time, there wasn't that much yet.

160
01:06:30,066 --> 01:06:31,366
If you're thinking of developing a system

161
01:06:31,366 --> 01:06:33,699
Or something more mission-critical.

162
01:06:33,699 --> 01:06:34,966
Or in the financial sector.

163
01:06:34,966 --> 01:06:36,166
That way.

164
01:06:36,166 --> 01:06:38,666
Something like that on the Internet?

165
01:06:38,666 --> 01:06:40,333
You were still new.

166
01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:42,233
Right.

167
01:06:42,233 --> 01:06:45,266
Now I can get GPS in the background.

168
01:06:45,266 --> 01:06:47,033
Because since I sent the GPS.

169
01:06:47,033 --> 01:06:50,166
He waited a few tens of seconds and finally got GPS.

170
01:06:50,166 --> 01:06:52,066
That was the time.

171
01:06:52,066 --> 01:06:53,266
I know, right?

172
01:06:53,266 --> 01:06:55,366
From all these places.

173
01:06:55,366 --> 01:06:56,900
I can get GPS.

174
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:58,300
Or maybe it's bluetooth.

175
01:06:58,300 --> 01:06:59,633
With all kinds of things.

176
01:06:59,633 --> 01:07:02,733
Things like figuring out your place in the world.

177
01:07:02,733 --> 01:07:06,500
It didn't used to be like that.

178
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:10,766
And at that time, it was still very run-of-the-mill.

179
01:07:10,766 --> 01:07:12,400
What kind of service would that have been?

180
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,733
But map-based?

181
01:07:13,733 --> 01:07:19,366
At that time, many people were looking for that store.

182
01:07:19,366 --> 01:07:20,966
On a gourmet site or something.

183
01:07:20,966 --> 01:07:23,500
It's like it can tell you where the nearest store is.

184
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:26,800
Since that time, it's been called "location games.

185
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:30,000
There were games that used location data.

186
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,866
It's still not as common as it used to be.

187
01:07:33,866 --> 01:07:35,933
It was on KyoPon or something like that.

188
01:07:35,933 --> 01:07:37,599
Legendary.

189
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,066
Great machine.

190
01:07:38,066 --> 01:07:43,233
You don't even know what you're doing.

191
01:07:43,233 --> 01:07:45,633
I see. I see.

192
01:07:45,633 --> 01:07:48,766
I still think you should use GPS.

193
01:07:48,766 --> 01:07:50,633
Nowadays, it's really more like a "location game.

194
01:07:50,633 --> 01:07:53,133
They don't even say "location game" anymore?

195
01:07:53,133 --> 01:07:55,666
The word "location game" itself is not so common anymore.

196
01:07:55,666 --> 01:07:58,866
After a lot of that stuff came out.

197
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:00,566
It's called "location games.

198
01:08:00,566 --> 01:08:03,733
Like, really, those traveling people.

199
01:08:03,733 --> 01:08:06,566
While riding a bus or a bullet train.

200
01:08:06,566 --> 01:08:08,866
All over the country, really.

201
01:08:08,866 --> 01:08:12,133
Anyway, it's like getting a GPS.

202
01:08:12,133 --> 01:08:14,433
You've been through a lot.

203
01:08:14,433 --> 01:08:16,633
I see, a geo-media community.

204
01:08:16,633 --> 01:08:18,933
But I'm glad that someone like you came.

205
01:08:18,933 --> 01:08:20,933
I'll tell you what, this isn't a "location game" matchup.

206
01:08:20,933 --> 01:08:23,800
We'd talk and stuff.

207
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:25,633
That's right.

208
01:08:25,633 --> 01:08:27,500
Those were really interesting times.

209
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:31,300
Many new services were born.

210
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:33,833
Sure, you know, like a programming contest.

211
01:08:33,833 --> 01:08:36,800
But it's still something we've been serving.

212
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,633
Back in the day.

213
01:08:38,633 --> 01:08:41,933
I really need to put something on the map now.

214
01:08:41,933 --> 01:08:45,233
That's what I'm talking about. I can search only for barbecue restaurants.

215
01:08:45,233 --> 01:08:46,166
Make a map.

216
01:08:46,166 --> 01:08:49,800
It's one service on the Yakiniku map.

217
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:52,666
I couldn't even do that without programming it, though.

218
01:08:52,666 --> 01:08:54,733
Nowadays, it's all about BI tools.

219
01:08:54,733 --> 01:08:56,666
Or maybe you can just map it.

220
01:08:56,666 --> 01:08:58,166
JavaScript and libraries.

221
01:08:58,166 --> 01:08:59,833
There's a lot going on.

222
01:08:59,833 --> 01:09:02,233
Put it on CMS or something and show it on a map like this.

223
01:09:02,233 --> 01:09:03,233
Or showing polygons.

224
01:09:03,233 --> 01:09:05,733
You can do so many things with it.

225
01:09:05,733 --> 01:09:08,166
That word "mashup" was so popular.

226
01:09:08,166 --> 01:09:10,366
Maybe Google will release an API or something.

227
01:09:10,366 --> 01:09:13,600
I really don't know if there are any map-related services.

228
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,899
It's much easier to make.

229
01:09:15,899 --> 01:09:18,000
And then the iPhone came out.

230
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,066
Finally, in the background.

231
01:09:19,066 --> 01:09:21,300
Tell him I can get GPS now.

232
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:22,266
That's really where it started.

233
01:09:22,266 --> 01:09:25,966
There's been an explosion of different services.

234
01:09:25,966 --> 01:09:28,566
Mashup awards and other program contests

235
01:09:28,566 --> 01:09:31,533
I've been on the receiving end.

236
01:09:31,533 --> 01:09:33,166
But the people who made it...

237
01:09:33,166 --> 01:09:34,766
I guess it's Google now.

238
01:09:34,766 --> 01:09:36,766
And then there was Mr. Fujii.

239
01:09:36,766 --> 01:09:39,100
I'm still in that SUN MICROSYSTEMS or something.

240
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:40,466
I just went to a recruiter.

241
01:09:40,466 --> 01:09:42,633
It's like a non-profit organization or something.

242
01:09:42,633 --> 01:09:44,966
Something about a bunch of people from that area.

243
01:09:44,966 --> 01:09:47,433
When I was doing the contest.

244
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:48,699
Really its a mashup

245
01:09:48,699 --> 01:09:49,166
If anything...

246
01:09:49,166 --> 01:09:51,566
The word "mashup" used to be a musical term.

247
01:09:51,566 --> 01:09:53,800
Come to the programming world.

248
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:57,933
It's hard to explain APIs to people.

249
01:09:57,933 --> 01:09:59,899
I guess so.

250
01:09:59,899 --> 01:10:02,066
I'm that reporter from the newspaper.

251
01:10:02,066 --> 01:10:06,666
I got into a fight with a reporter from the newspaper.

252
01:10:06,666 --> 01:10:09,633
They're going to put the service up.

253
01:10:09,633 --> 01:10:11,866
I don't know if it's an API.

254
01:10:11,866 --> 01:10:13,966
He wants to change it to Japanese.

255
01:10:13,966 --> 01:10:16,233
It's even harder to understand in Japanese.

256
01:10:16,233 --> 01:10:17,899
I wish someone would understand this.

257
01:10:17,899 --> 01:10:20,199
Tell them they need to write it in API.

258
01:10:20,199 --> 01:10:22,500
Then he told me to use katakana.

259
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,466
No, you don't know any better.

260
01:10:24,466 --> 01:10:27,000
A.P.I." in katakana.

261
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
So just say it.

262
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,566
Then the other members of the group asked me if I had any questions.

263
01:10:29,566 --> 01:10:31,600
I'm just trying to make you look bad.

264
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:35,600
You asked me to speak more softly.

265
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,800
From now on, I'll use katakana for that kind of thing.

266
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,100
Even in those terms.

267
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:41,000
Because it's going to become more and more common.

268
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,399
API is called API.

269
01:10:43,399 --> 01:10:46,733
Tell him I want him to write it in the alphabet.

270
01:10:46,733 --> 01:10:48,866
On the phone, on the phone.

271
01:10:48,866 --> 01:10:50,766
It's amazing.

272
01:10:50,766 --> 01:10:52,233
But I couldn't communicate at all.

273
01:10:52,233 --> 01:10:54,466
Katakana API after all

274
01:10:54,466 --> 01:10:57,399
The World

275
01:10:57,399 --> 01:10:59,866
I feel like I've come to terms with that.

276
01:10:59,866 --> 01:11:01,833
It's so normal now.

277
01:11:01,833 --> 01:11:05,600
It's just a normal, generic API.

278
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,566
Even from non-engineers.

279
01:11:07,566 --> 01:11:08,699
Let's do it via API.

280
01:11:08,699 --> 01:11:10,633
I've started to hear things like.

281
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:14,566
APIs were not that common back then.

282
01:11:14,566 --> 01:11:16,233
Yes, well, to begin with.

283
01:11:16,233 --> 01:11:17,633
such

284
01:11:17,633 --> 01:11:20,066
We need to get our computing resources out there.

285
01:11:20,066 --> 01:11:21,966
The very idea of exposing it via API.

286
01:11:21,966 --> 01:11:22,966
Hey.

287
01:11:22,966 --> 01:11:25,066
It wasn't there, was it?

288
01:11:25,066 --> 01:11:29,899
I knew it was something.

289
01:11:29,899 --> 01:11:32,399
Well, that's where I originally got involved with data.

290
01:11:32,399 --> 01:11:33,466
It's just a trigger.

291
01:11:33,466 --> 01:11:35,800
The data we've created.

292
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,699
Why go public?

293
01:11:37,699 --> 01:11:39,433
And it's called open data.

294
01:11:39,433 --> 01:11:41,166
I even came up with a concept.

295
01:11:41,166 --> 01:11:43,466
Why do you have to do that?

296
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:45,633
I don't get paid that much.

297
01:11:45,633 --> 01:11:48,133
And then there are things like that.

298
01:11:48,133 --> 01:11:51,666
But then again, I was involved in open source.

299
01:11:51,666 --> 01:11:53,666
That's the way it is, isn't it?

300
01:11:53,666 --> 01:11:56,500
We have to create our own value now.

301
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:57,600
Open Source and

302
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,766
It's like an open API, but also a little different.

303
01:12:00,766 --> 01:12:03,333
And Google is still doing this for free.

304
01:12:03,333 --> 01:12:06,666
By exposing map data through APIs.

305
01:12:06,666 --> 01:12:08,866
Including that Japan.

306
01:12:08,866 --> 01:12:12,300
The world's geographic information industry

307
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:13,966
You've already changed so much.

308
01:12:13,966 --> 01:12:17,033
It was already too rough. That was...

309
01:12:17,033 --> 01:12:19,000
Until then, I'm selling map data.

310
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,500
That's what I was in the business of doing.

311
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:22,166
Create an application on top of it.

312
01:12:22,166 --> 01:12:24,966
Like making money from the traffic of it.

313
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:26,333
What is a model?

314
01:12:26,333 --> 01:12:28,100
It's not so easy anymore.

315
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:30,866
It's not like I was born in Japan.

316
01:12:30,866 --> 01:12:33,566
It's symbolic, though.

317
01:12:33,566 --> 01:12:35,766
I knew there was something to it.

318
01:12:35,766 --> 01:12:37,866
I wonder if it's just a coincidence that the first one was also a coincidence.

319
01:12:37,866 --> 01:12:39,033
In the course of my work.

320
01:12:39,033 --> 01:12:42,633
Or there's some kind of GPS that can do this.

321
01:12:42,633 --> 01:12:44,566
I just wanted to come over there.

322
01:12:44,566 --> 01:12:46,566
Well, did you enter Sirius or something?

323
01:12:46,566 --> 01:12:47,166
first

324
01:12:47,166 --> 01:12:48,333
Yes, well, at first.

325
01:12:48,333 --> 01:12:51,199
I knew that GPS was interesting.

326
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:56,566
He came in and said he wanted to do a GPS-based service.

327
01:12:56,566 --> 01:13:01,333
Eventually, when I got into Sirius, it was pretty much that.

328
01:13:01,333 --> 01:13:05,233
That ad-serving service requires a medium, doesn't it?

329
01:13:05,233 --> 01:13:09,800
There wasn't much media at the time.

330
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,133
Not yet.

331
01:13:11,133 --> 01:13:12,766
Send me that GPS.

332
01:13:12,766 --> 01:13:15,366
It was a world of waiting for a few tens of seconds.

333
01:13:15,366 --> 01:13:18,500
We need that many media.

334
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:20,899
And that's why I decided to hold that study session.

335
01:13:20,899 --> 01:13:22,733
Do a free conference.

336
01:13:22,733 --> 01:13:27,466
It's like a way to boost the location-based industry.

337
01:13:27,466 --> 01:13:30,366
I established the Geo Media Summit.

338
01:13:30,366 --> 01:13:30,533
Oh, yeah.

339
01:13:30,533 --> 01:13:31,366
yes

340
01:13:31,366 --> 01:13:32,133
That's right!

341
01:13:32,133 --> 01:13:33,666
Geo-media is also a thing.

342
01:13:33,666 --> 01:13:35,666
It's a term we all coined on our own.

343
01:13:35,666 --> 01:13:37,166
It only works in Japan.

344
01:13:37,166 --> 01:13:38,533
Yeah, I know.

345
01:13:38,533 --> 01:13:40,000
Nowadays, geomedia is not a word.

346
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,633
It's not much anymore.

347
01:13:41,633 --> 01:13:43,466
Yes, it was Geo x Media.

348
01:13:43,466 --> 01:13:44,466
Until then, and before that.

349
01:13:44,466 --> 01:13:46,600
I was told it was GIS or something.

350
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:47,500
That's not what I meant.

351
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:49,166
Because we need media services.

352
01:13:49,166 --> 01:13:51,666
I was like, let's get that going.

353
01:13:51,666 --> 01:13:54,533
That's why I started this community.

354
01:13:54,533 --> 01:13:57,199
I think it's all connected to the present.

355
01:13:57,199 --> 01:13:58,833
I have a feeling.

356
01:13:58,833 --> 01:14:00,333
I'm often asked by the local government...

357
01:14:00,333 --> 01:14:02,500
What is the difference between GIS and geomedia?

358
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,133
You know, the kind of inquiry.

359
01:14:04,133 --> 01:14:05,766
I had it on the web.

360
01:14:05,766 --> 01:14:11,133
Well, I made it up as I went along.

361
01:14:11,133 --> 01:14:12,866
I knew the word "geomedia" was

362
01:14:12,866 --> 01:14:15,166
The GIS industry is old-fashioned, isn't it?

363
01:14:15,166 --> 01:14:18,300
The surveying and various other things.

364
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:20,166
From the real map industry

365
01:14:20,166 --> 01:14:22,100
Until it develops into data.

366
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:25,800
There are some very well-established people who are doing this.

367
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:28,100
It's like Google or something.

368
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:29,366
He jumped in with a bang.

369
01:14:29,366 --> 01:14:31,166
This is a long-established company and this is a venture.

370
01:14:31,166 --> 01:14:33,433
Pretty much, that confrontation.

371
01:14:33,433 --> 01:14:34,433
I was very much in that era.

372
01:14:34,433 --> 01:14:35,433
I think that was the most fun.

373
01:14:35,433 --> 01:14:37,233
Yay, interesting.

374
01:14:37,233 --> 01:14:41,366
To be able to witness such a drastic change in the industry.

375
01:14:41,366 --> 01:14:43,366
That's really interesting.

376
01:14:43,366 --> 01:14:45,899
Maybe even when the Internet was created.

377
01:14:45,899 --> 01:14:47,466
Something about that geomedia system.

378
01:14:47,466 --> 01:14:52,233
That old, that industry and that new place.

379
01:14:52,233 --> 01:14:53,100
I don't know.

380
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:56,199
We'll have to admit it to each other.

381
01:14:56,199 --> 01:14:58,733
There were times when you were kind of buzzing.

382
01:14:58,733 --> 01:15:03,199
It's something about being part of a community when you're in that area.

383
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:05,033
It was the most fun I've ever had.

384
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:07,199
Certainly when something is changing.

385
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:09,433
So that's what it means.

386
01:15:09,433 --> 01:15:10,199
But until then...

387
01:15:10,199 --> 01:15:12,899
Did the community do a lot of things?

388
01:15:12,899 --> 01:15:15,399
There are so many IT communities now.

389
01:15:15,399 --> 01:15:18,966
You're kind of a symbol, Seki-san.

390
01:15:18,966 --> 01:15:19,966
It's not like I was doing it.

391
01:15:19,966 --> 01:15:23,100
You were a participant.

392
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:25,033
A lot of what we call communities.

393
01:15:25,033 --> 01:15:26,166
Yeah, there's been a lot going on.

394
01:15:26,166 --> 01:15:29,000
I was the first one to debut in the community.

395
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,300
I still remember it.

396
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:33,333
There is something called Zope (Plone).

397
01:15:33,333 --> 01:15:34,566
It's a CMS.

398
01:15:34,566 --> 01:15:36,199
So we used it internally.

399
01:15:36,199 --> 01:15:36,833
Heh.

400
01:15:36,833 --> 01:15:38,933
I heard there was a study session at the

401
01:15:38,933 --> 01:15:41,399
I applied for that study group.

402
01:15:41,399 --> 01:15:43,166
when one does so

403
01:15:43,166 --> 01:15:45,399
Why don't we do that lightning talk?

404
01:15:45,399 --> 01:15:46,433
I was told.

405
01:15:46,433 --> 01:15:47,033
What's that?

406
01:15:47,033 --> 01:15:48,466
It's a presentation.

407
01:15:48,466 --> 01:15:49,800
No, no, no, no, no.

408
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,266
I've been using it for a bit.

409
01:15:51,266 --> 01:15:53,600
It's not something you talk about in public.

410
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:54,833
I don't have it.

411
01:15:54,833 --> 01:15:56,466
By the way, when I told him I was doing this.

412
01:15:56,466 --> 01:15:59,666
He said, "No problem, it's only five minutes.

413
01:15:59,666 --> 01:16:02,233
He asked me to talk to you because you're funny.

414
01:16:02,233 --> 01:16:02,899
I told you.

415
01:16:02,899 --> 01:16:04,766
I was so nervous talking to him.

416
01:16:04,766 --> 01:16:06,100
When you first joined?

417
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:07,000
oh, yes!

418
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,166
That makes me nervous.

419
01:16:09,166 --> 01:16:10,899
But then...

420
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:14,366
I've been getting a lot of feedback.

421
01:16:14,366 --> 01:16:16,133
Oh, he said it was great fun.

422
01:16:16,133 --> 01:16:17,500
From there, it's pretty much all open source.

423
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:18,933
Join the community.

424
01:16:18,933 --> 01:16:19,733
That Zope (Plone) stuff.

425
01:16:19,733 --> 01:16:21,233
Like going to study groups.

426
01:16:21,233 --> 01:16:22,533
And OSC.

427
01:16:22,533 --> 01:16:25,066
I'll be at that event or something.

428
01:16:25,066 --> 01:16:27,466
I've been talking to a lot of people.

429
01:16:27,466 --> 01:16:29,166
Or help set up a booth.

430
01:16:29,166 --> 01:16:31,233
That's the kind of thing you were doing.

431
01:16:31,233 --> 01:16:32,266
I see.

432
01:16:32,266 --> 01:16:35,566
There's something about community.

433
01:16:35,566 --> 01:16:38,300
I'll take the geomedia type stuff.

434
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:39,366
I'm really glad I started this.

435
01:16:39,366 --> 01:16:40,800
I thought it might be the first.

436
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,466
I can't imagine being a participant anymore.

437
01:16:43,466 --> 01:16:44,266
The World

438
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:47,466
I can't help but feel like I'm presiding over it.

439
01:16:47,466 --> 01:16:48,500
No, no, not at all.

440
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:53,300
I don't feel like there's a gang leader in that OSC group.

441
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:55,100
I was just a regular participant.

442
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:56,566
I see.

443
01:16:56,566 --> 01:16:59,199
If you want to start up your own business, you can do so.

444
01:16:59,199 --> 01:17:01,833
To some extent, I was thinking about how community works.

445
01:17:01,833 --> 01:17:03,666
I'm not sure what to say about that.

446
01:17:03,666 --> 01:17:04,433
Did you find it?

447
01:17:04,433 --> 01:17:06,833
No, it's not like that at all.

448
01:17:06,833 --> 01:17:08,166
What is that in the first place?

449
01:17:08,166 --> 01:17:10,266
The idea of having a community like that.

450
01:17:10,266 --> 01:17:11,800
It's not like that.

451
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:13,066
The Geo-media Summit is

452
01:17:13,066 --> 01:17:15,466
We're not a tech community.

453
01:17:15,466 --> 01:17:18,899
Well, it started out as just a drinking party.

454
01:17:18,899 --> 01:17:20,866
Oh, I see.

455
01:17:20,866 --> 01:17:22,100
It's a way to boost the industry.

456
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:24,933
I'll give you a technical talk.

457
01:17:24,933 --> 01:17:26,133
And not only that, but also...

458
01:17:26,133 --> 01:17:28,633
I'm in the media industry.

459
01:17:28,633 --> 01:17:32,399
Of course, there were a lot of non-technical people like this.

460
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:36,733
So, I have three conditions.

461
01:17:36,733 --> 01:17:41,600
That "openness, neutrality, and emphasis on interaction".

462
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,833
People from various industries gather here.

463
01:17:43,833 --> 01:17:45,399
That particular

464
01:17:45,399 --> 01:17:47,566
For example, for Sirius Technologies.

465
01:17:47,566 --> 01:17:49,733
If you do that, the competition won't be able to come.

466
01:17:49,733 --> 01:17:52,133
Let's not do that.

467
01:17:52,133 --> 01:17:54,199
That's what I'm doing with the other people in the open.

468
01:17:54,199 --> 01:17:56,366
Neutral.

469
01:17:56,366 --> 01:17:58,666
He said we should discuss the information openly.

470
01:17:58,666 --> 01:18:00,833
It's just that...

471
01:18:00,833 --> 01:18:02,933
There's something off the record, too.

472
01:18:02,933 --> 01:18:04,766
It's a gentleman's agreement.

473
01:18:04,766 --> 01:18:07,733
Let's have a drink and talk in a place that emphasizes interaction.

474
01:18:07,733 --> 01:18:10,466
We were talking about something like that.

475
01:18:10,466 --> 01:18:11,699
It was really exciting.

476
01:18:11,699 --> 01:18:13,899
It was good, though.

477
01:18:13,899 --> 01:18:15,000
Well, then...

478
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,433
It's more like a study group from inside the company.

479
01:18:18,433 --> 01:18:19,433
Right in there.

480
01:18:19,433 --> 01:18:22,033
It's just a place where you can come if you know someone.

481
01:18:22,033 --> 01:18:24,300
How much is the maximum?It's pretty big.

482
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:27,166
Well, yes, maybe up to.

483
01:18:27,166 --> 01:18:31,033
I think it became a place where about 300 people gathered.

484
01:18:31,033 --> 01:18:34,266
At first, it was really that location information.

485
01:18:34,266 --> 01:18:40,633
The idea is to get together with people who can drink with this latitude and longitude as a snack.

486
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:43,566
It hasn't changed when we got to 300 people, though. There.

487
01:18:43,566 --> 01:18:46,633
It was a heavy drinking party. A New Year's party, I think.

488
01:18:46,633 --> 01:18:48,933
And then 50 or 60 people showed up.

489
01:18:48,933 --> 01:18:50,699
It was a very dense situation.

490
01:18:50,699 --> 01:18:53,366
It's usually always thick.

491
01:18:53,366 --> 01:18:54,566
Because this is interesting.

492
01:18:54,566 --> 01:18:56,033
Let's make it more like a study group.

493
01:18:56,033 --> 01:18:59,000
That's how it started.

494
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,033
And even then, it was not just Sirius.

495
01:19:01,033 --> 01:19:03,300
Also, Sirius has a venerable image.

496
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:04,266
Very.

497
01:19:04,266 --> 01:19:06,533
I've always had an image of you as a venture capitalist.

498
01:19:06,533 --> 01:19:07,500
That's what I'm talking about.

499
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:09,466
There were a lot of people who were doing it.

500
01:19:09,466 --> 01:19:14,199
There were a lot of them, like Mapion.

501
01:19:14,199 --> 01:19:20,199
It was interesting to see the participation from so many different companies.

502
01:19:20,199 --> 01:19:22,899
These people are definitely geo-media types.

503
01:19:22,899 --> 01:19:24,366
Or Yahoo.

504
01:19:24,366 --> 01:19:26,066
Yes, I know.

505
01:19:26,066 --> 01:19:30,100
How long did you do the Geo Media Summit?

506
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:33,866
Probably not more than ten years old.

507
01:19:33,866 --> 01:19:36,066
That long, I see.

508
01:19:36,066 --> 01:19:39,199
It's been about six or seven years, I think.

509
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:40,333
Okay, that's long enough.

510
01:19:40,333 --> 01:19:44,300
That's why Mr. Seki was so interested in the Geomedia Summit.

511
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:46,600
Representative, when you decided to quit.

512
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,300
He said he's quitting.

513
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:53,000
It's not like Seki-san made an announcement.

514
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,500
Or maybe the announcement was made in a more confined area.

515
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:57,800
I've announced something.

516
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:00,000
At some conference.

517
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,633
"Seki, you're not representing us anymore.

518
01:20:01,633 --> 01:20:04,633
And then, somehow, it became a rumor.

519
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:06,233
Seki, you're not representing us anymore.

520
01:20:06,233 --> 01:20:08,833
Just like in that movie.

521
01:20:08,833 --> 01:20:10,100
I had one just like it.

522
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:12,566
It's like, "Hey, I'm quitting the club.

523
01:20:12,566 --> 01:20:13,733
Just like that one.

524
01:20:13,733 --> 01:20:14,800
What's the real story?

525
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:15,899
Something like that.

526
01:20:15,899 --> 01:20:18,866
Rumors started to spread.

527
01:20:18,866 --> 01:20:20,966
Anyway, there's something about the next Geomedia Summit.

528
01:20:20,966 --> 01:20:22,066
I have to show my face.

529
01:20:22,066 --> 01:20:25,833
It's like it's some kind of retirement ceremony.

530
01:20:25,833 --> 01:20:28,166
Are you really going to stop?Oh, but you won't stop.

531
01:20:28,166 --> 01:20:29,833
Something like that.

532
01:20:29,833 --> 01:20:34,199
It was like a buzz, and it really came in waves!

533
01:20:34,199 --> 01:20:35,533
Heh heh heh.

534
01:20:35,533 --> 01:20:37,433
I see.

535
01:20:37,433 --> 01:20:39,066
Me at that time

536
01:20:39,066 --> 01:20:41,466
I didn't say much at that time.

537
01:20:41,466 --> 01:20:43,266
I don't know if it was there.

538
01:20:43,266 --> 01:20:44,966
I thought you looked like Seki.

539
01:20:44,966 --> 01:20:47,500
I don't know where I said that something.

540
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:50,533
I've been hearing rumors of something like this on the World Wide Web.

541
01:20:50,533 --> 01:20:51,366
It's like I'm becoming...

542
01:20:51,366 --> 01:20:54,566
I'm sure he knows that.

543
01:20:54,566 --> 01:20:57,066
It's not like you're going to say something else somewhere else.

544
01:20:57,066 --> 01:21:01,800
At any rate, the rumors keep coming.

545
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:03,466
I'd like to know what you think is so funny.

546
01:21:03,466 --> 01:21:05,666
I remember how we all said it together.

547
01:21:05,666 --> 01:21:07,300
Is that so?

548
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:08,966
So where did you do it?

549
01:21:08,966 --> 01:21:11,266
Something like that in Odaiba or something.

550
01:21:11,266 --> 01:21:12,166
Oh yeah, the one in Odaiba.

551
01:21:12,166 --> 01:21:15,066
In a technology exhibition.

552
01:21:15,066 --> 01:21:17,066
I got a frame announcement.

553
01:21:17,066 --> 01:21:18,600
It was a long time before that.

554
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:20,366
It's been a while since I've seen you.

555
01:21:20,366 --> 01:21:23,600
At that time, I already said I'd quit representing Seki.

556
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:26,199
By now, we've all heard about it.

557
01:21:26,199 --> 01:21:27,633
That's what I'm talking about.

558
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:28,300
that's right!

559
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,766
Yeah, and when I get there, I'll make an announcement.

560
01:21:30,766 --> 01:21:32,500
Oh, you mean they knew about it before you announced it.

561
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:35,466
Maybe that's why he said he'd quit something.

562
01:21:35,466 --> 01:21:39,333
I was wondering if they were going to make an announcement when I got there.

563
01:21:39,333 --> 01:21:44,533
I said, "Odaiba is too far," but I went there.

564
01:21:44,533 --> 01:21:47,333
So you went in and didn't announce it?

565
01:21:47,333 --> 01:21:48,466
Oh, there it is.

566
01:21:48,466 --> 01:21:51,800
Maybe they did it in Odaiba.

567
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:56,000
But it was all very smooth.

568
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,033
At any rate, I'm sure there's some kind of

569
01:21:58,033 --> 01:22:00,766
We were talking about looking at that map of the river.

570
01:22:00,766 --> 01:22:02,500
Everyone or something was really excited about that one.

571
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:06,100
How can you get excited about this and drink alcohol?

572
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:09,433
We all say things like that.

573
01:22:09,433 --> 01:22:11,633
There was just something about "OK, Google".

574
01:22:11,633 --> 01:22:14,466
Someone brought it back from overseas.

575
01:22:14,466 --> 01:22:15,566
Even if you pronounce it.

576
01:22:15,566 --> 01:22:17,866
People can't hear "OK, Google.

577
01:22:17,866 --> 01:22:19,433
Or something like that.

578
01:22:19,433 --> 01:22:20,733
Something like that.

579
01:22:20,733 --> 01:22:23,899
Really Geek Gathering

580
01:22:23,899 --> 01:22:26,199
Earlier, there was that non-techie guy.

581
01:22:26,199 --> 01:22:27,866
You said you were here.

582
01:22:27,866 --> 01:22:29,033
I don't know about those people either.

583
01:22:29,033 --> 01:22:31,766
It's a little bit like being in touch with the tech world.

584
01:22:31,766 --> 01:22:34,600
I'm not a very technical person at all.

585
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,633
What's with the location information?

586
01:22:36,633 --> 01:22:39,533
It's easy to imagine it as a service.

587
01:22:39,533 --> 01:22:42,933
At the time, it was all about "location and something else.

588
01:22:42,933 --> 01:22:44,300
It's a combination of things.

589
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:48,500
It was a new service that was taking shape.

590
01:22:48,500 --> 01:22:50,500
It was easy to get into, too.

591
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:51,300
Right.

592
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,600
Yeah, it was still a bit early at that time.

593
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:56,866
Geo could have been the main character.

594
01:22:56,866 --> 01:22:58,966
By combining them, services can be changed.

595
01:22:58,966 --> 01:23:00,633
It was a time like that.

596
01:23:00,633 --> 01:23:02,233
It's the norm now.

597
01:23:02,233 --> 01:23:06,066
It's like I don't have to say anything.

598
01:23:06,066 --> 01:23:08,633
So I've been trying to get some kind of geodata.

599
01:23:08,633 --> 01:23:10,899
You said you distinguished it from data.

600
01:23:10,899 --> 01:23:13,566
Data that doesn't have location information on it.

601
01:23:13,566 --> 01:23:16,000
I'd rather deal with it in the Internet.

602
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,899
It's no longer something difficult to do.

603
01:23:18,899 --> 01:23:20,300
It's normal.

604
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:21,933
Right.

605
01:23:21,933 --> 01:23:25,566
From a geo-media type place.

606
01:23:25,566 --> 01:23:28,466
So, it's like a first step.

607
01:23:28,466 --> 01:23:30,500
Engineers. I know they did it to you originally.

608
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:32,166
I'm getting more and more interested in that side of things.

609
01:23:32,166 --> 01:23:34,933
In the midst of doing service.

610
01:23:34,933 --> 01:23:37,866
I went to a place called Social Issues.

611
01:23:37,866 --> 01:23:39,533
Some kind of turning point.

612
01:23:39,533 --> 01:23:41,733
You have a reason?

613
01:23:41,733 --> 01:23:43,733
This is, after all.

614
01:23:43,733 --> 01:23:49,933
Can I have this?

615
01:23:49,933 --> 01:23:52,533
Tohoku earthquake (March 11, 2011)

616
01:23:52,533 --> 01:23:53,866
I knew it. "sinsai.info".

617
01:23:53,866 --> 01:23:55,833
I mean, the activities around it.

618
01:23:55,833 --> 01:23:57,566
Mm-hmm.

619
01:23:57,566 --> 01:24:00,300
Before that.

620
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:04,666
It's not that I wasn't interested at all.

621
01:24:04,666 --> 01:24:08,366
Maybe I feel exactly the same as a normal person.

622
01:24:08,366 --> 01:24:10,333
If it were normal...

623
01:24:10,333 --> 01:24:11,033
If you live a normal life.

624
01:24:11,033 --> 01:24:14,133
You want to do something useful for the world, don't you?

625
01:24:14,133 --> 01:24:15,766
but

626
01:24:15,766 --> 01:24:18,966
I didn't feel like I was actively trying to do anything.

627
01:24:18,966 --> 01:24:19,800
I just had a thought.

628
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:21,566
When the baby was born.

629
01:24:21,566 --> 01:24:25,033
Too much information about parenting.

630
01:24:25,033 --> 01:24:28,366
I think there's still a lack of it on the Internet.

631
01:24:28,366 --> 01:24:30,366
I was wondering if there was anything I could do.

632
01:24:30,366 --> 01:24:32,366
Make the task a little more realistic.

633
01:24:32,366 --> 01:24:33,600
It's just that I've learned to see it.

634
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:38,033
It was about a year before the earthquake.

635
01:24:38,033 --> 01:24:42,666
The Great East Japan Earthquake happened in the middle of it all.

636
01:24:42,666 --> 01:24:45,133
You've been delivering ads.

637
01:24:45,133 --> 01:24:46,699
The ad serving service is

638
01:24:46,699 --> 01:24:50,666
That's when it became completely unnecessary.

639
01:24:50,666 --> 01:24:53,233
Yahoo! stopped advertising that ad, too.

640
01:24:53,233 --> 01:24:54,366
Hmm, I see.

641
01:24:54,366 --> 01:24:56,666
That's not the point.

642
01:24:56,666 --> 01:24:59,933
So, in a nutshell, I'm out of a job.

643
01:24:59,933 --> 01:25:02,033
Like there's nothing to do.

644
01:25:02,033 --> 01:25:05,233
In the midst of all this, I came across "sinsai.info".

645
01:25:05,233 --> 01:25:08,133
Using open source software.

646
01:25:08,133 --> 01:25:09,899
I'm trying to gather information on crowdsourcing.

647
01:25:09,899 --> 01:25:12,266
I've been involved in the

648
01:25:12,266 --> 01:25:14,266
That was a great experience.

649
01:25:14,266 --> 01:25:15,166
hmm

650
01:25:15,166 --> 01:25:16,866
It's like this.

651
01:25:16,866 --> 01:25:19,566
I'm, well, a geomedia guy.

652
01:25:19,566 --> 01:25:21,233
You know, the technology you've developed.

653
01:25:21,233 --> 01:25:22,733
That's what it's all about.

654
01:25:22,733 --> 01:25:25,000
I think it might be useful in this way.

655
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,933
That's how you got started?

656
01:25:27,933 --> 01:25:30,733
I don't know what to say.

657
01:25:30,733 --> 01:25:35,366
That's because I happen to be involved in the open source community.

658
01:25:35,366 --> 01:25:39,166
I'm involved in the OpenStreetMap community.

659
01:25:39,166 --> 01:25:41,899
The earthquake happened, and I called immediately.

660
01:25:41,899 --> 01:25:45,433
I was able to confirm the safety of my family and others.

661
01:25:45,433 --> 01:25:46,800
So when you say, "What should I do?

662
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,866
With all of them.

663
01:25:48,866 --> 01:25:51,333
Yahoo! was located in Midtown at that time.

664
01:25:51,333 --> 01:25:55,566
Evacuate to that park behind Midtown.

665
01:25:55,566 --> 01:25:56,566
Watching the news and stuff.

666
01:25:56,566 --> 01:25:59,266
I thought this was going to be a big deal.

667
01:25:59,266 --> 01:26:00,733
on the verge of

668
01:26:00,733 --> 01:26:03,433
Mr. Miura, who represented OpenStreetMap at the time, said

669
01:26:03,433 --> 01:26:05,733
People are on the mailing list.

670
01:26:05,733 --> 01:26:07,233
I was sending you an email.

671
01:26:07,233 --> 01:26:09,933
Now is the time to do something about it.

672
01:26:09,933 --> 01:26:13,100
That's where the pan switches over.

673
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:17,000
Other people and stuff are working together now.

674
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,433
A man named Azuma-san.

675
01:26:18,433 --> 01:26:23,699
It was used in Haiti the year before that.

676
01:26:23,699 --> 01:26:25,966
With this open source

677
01:26:25,966 --> 01:26:28,000
I said maybe we can do the same thing in Japan.

678
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,933
Tell him I'd like to try that.

679
01:26:30,933 --> 01:26:32,233
That's it.

680
01:26:32,233 --> 01:26:33,566
Oh, my God.

681
01:26:33,566 --> 01:26:35,766
For now, everyone should go home for the time being.

682
01:26:35,766 --> 01:26:37,566
As I walked home.

683
01:26:37,566 --> 01:26:40,000
I did a lot of work on that email.

684
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,899
It's like I've been coding since I got back.

685
01:26:42,899 --> 01:26:45,000
That's how it all started.

686
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,766
That's why it's not like that.

687
01:26:47,766 --> 01:26:50,066
It's not like, "Okay.

688
01:26:50,066 --> 01:26:52,933
I don't know, I just happen to know what I can do.

689
01:26:52,933 --> 01:26:55,300
Like, it was right in front of me, so I just kept doing it.

690
01:26:55,300 --> 01:26:57,933
And then, before you know it, it's like this.

691
01:26:57,933 --> 01:27:00,033
And then, gradually, like this.

692
01:27:00,033 --> 01:27:01,899
I wanted to know so many things.

693
01:27:01,899 --> 01:27:05,066
It's like we're here now.

694
01:27:05,066 --> 01:27:08,333
Like the OpenStreetMap neighborhood.

695
01:27:08,333 --> 01:27:11,600
I was wondering if you were already asleep.

696
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:14,399
So many things are happening so fast.

697
01:27:14,399 --> 01:27:18,366
A lot of people have already committed to a lot of things.

698
01:27:18,366 --> 01:27:20,466
It's just that it's taking shape.

699
01:27:20,466 --> 01:27:22,966
I can already see blah, blah, blah.

700
01:27:22,966 --> 01:27:25,466
What's this like, who's doing this?

701
01:27:25,466 --> 01:27:27,966
I knew that movement was

702
01:27:27,966 --> 01:27:29,366
Great impact!

703
01:27:29,366 --> 01:27:30,766
I think there was.

704
01:27:30,766 --> 01:27:33,033
After all, even from the perspective of Seki and the others who are doing it.

705
01:27:33,033 --> 01:27:37,866
It's like I'm changing in some way.

706
01:27:37,866 --> 01:27:39,266
Something before that.

707
01:27:39,266 --> 01:27:42,800
I was a victim of the Great Hanshin Earthquake.

708
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:45,166
I don't really have any information.

709
01:27:45,166 --> 01:27:46,066
Even at that moment.

710
01:27:46,066 --> 01:27:48,266
Some newspapers have internet access.

711
01:27:48,266 --> 01:27:49,033
I've been through a lot.

712
01:27:49,033 --> 01:27:50,199
But to the general public.

713
01:27:50,199 --> 01:27:52,366
It's nothing like that.

714
01:27:52,366 --> 01:27:53,833
What happened?

715
01:27:53,833 --> 01:27:56,033
The roof of my apartment building fell down.

716
01:27:56,033 --> 01:27:58,133
That's all I was thinking about.

717
01:27:58,133 --> 01:28:01,166
But there was a burst gas line or something.

718
01:28:01,166 --> 01:28:04,333
It was like I shouldn't even be here.

719
01:28:04,333 --> 01:28:06,266
But I don't even know where to go.

720
01:28:06,266 --> 01:28:07,899
Or maybe you don't understand at all.

721
01:28:07,899 --> 01:28:10,233
I really don't have that kind of information.

722
01:28:10,233 --> 01:28:12,300
The Great East Japan Earthquake.

723
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:15,033
I saw that something this big happened again.

724
01:28:15,033 --> 01:28:18,666
But the way the information was conveyed at that time was different.

725
01:28:18,666 --> 01:28:20,300
So fast.

726
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:22,666
But you were just in Chicago.

727
01:28:22,666 --> 01:28:25,633
There was that Drupal conference.

728
01:28:25,633 --> 01:28:27,733
I've been over there.

729
01:28:27,733 --> 01:28:29,433
We were just getting here.

730
01:28:29,433 --> 01:28:33,266
I got there at 23:30.

731
01:28:33,266 --> 01:28:35,266
A while ago, in the middle of the night.

732
01:28:35,266 --> 01:28:36,766
I took the cheapest flight I could find.

733
01:28:36,766 --> 01:28:39,899
I came in the middle of the night and had nothing to eat.

734
01:28:39,899 --> 01:28:40,899
But it's a bit of a hotel.

735
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:43,166
The restaurant on the first floor said they'd open it for you.

736
01:28:43,166 --> 01:28:44,133
I don't have anything.

737
01:28:44,133 --> 01:28:46,066
Tell her it's easy if it's easy.

738
01:28:46,066 --> 01:28:46,699
There's Wi-Fi and stuff.

739
01:28:46,699 --> 01:28:49,933
As soon as you told me and I connected it.

740
01:28:49,933 --> 01:28:51,033
After about ten minutes.

741
01:28:51,033 --> 01:28:53,966
It was shaking, shaking, shaking.

742
01:28:53,966 --> 01:28:56,866
I was like, "What is this?

743
01:28:56,866 --> 01:29:00,100
Anyway, I went back to my room and turned on the TV.

744
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:01,699
I was already overseas.

745
01:29:01,699 --> 01:29:05,766
I'm already getting a lot of information, and it's already exploding.

746
01:29:05,766 --> 01:29:07,300
It's called a video.

747
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:09,333
But then I thought, "Well, I'll just do something here.

748
01:29:09,333 --> 01:29:12,066
I think it was some student.

749
01:29:12,066 --> 01:29:15,366
A junior high or high school kid on the Internet.

750
01:29:15,366 --> 01:29:17,066
What about Nico Nico Douga, was it a tweaker?

751
01:29:17,066 --> 01:29:18,666
It's like a tweak now.

752
01:29:18,666 --> 01:29:21,166
In the past, I don't know, maybe UStream.

753
01:29:21,166 --> 01:29:22,566
Run it out with something.

754
01:29:22,566 --> 01:29:26,366
And my friend's house.

755
01:29:26,366 --> 01:29:29,699
I was just at a friend's house in Kesennuma.

756
01:29:29,699 --> 01:29:33,233
I was just about to be swept away.

757
01:29:33,233 --> 01:29:35,333
I mean, what?I understand.

758
01:29:35,333 --> 01:29:37,833
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or not.

759
01:29:37,833 --> 01:29:39,399
Wait a minute. I want to wait a minute.

760
01:29:39,399 --> 01:29:42,100
There's so much information coming in.

761
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:43,766
I experienced it myself.

762
01:29:43,766 --> 01:29:47,066
In the old days of the earthquake, there was no information at all.

763
01:29:47,066 --> 01:29:49,333
I was just wondering if you could help me out with some information.

764
01:29:49,333 --> 01:29:51,933
I've been in some of these fields myself.

765
01:29:51,933 --> 01:29:55,866
Even if there is, there's nothing you can do about it.

766
01:29:55,866 --> 01:29:58,100
Seki and his team's activities made me feel like a buzz.

767
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:01,000
I'm taking that information and giving it form and value.

768
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,133
Something like that.

769
01:30:03,133 --> 01:30:06,333
I've been in some open source stuff.

770
01:30:06,333 --> 01:30:09,766
I'm not sure how to create value with it.

771
01:30:09,766 --> 01:30:12,533
I don't have that many positive ideas or anything.

772
01:30:12,533 --> 01:30:13,766
I don't know what to do.

773
01:30:13,766 --> 01:30:15,133
That's what's happening.

774
01:30:15,133 --> 01:30:17,866
I really wish I could make this and sell it.

775
01:30:17,866 --> 01:30:20,566
That source code, if you're selling it in a stiff way.

776
01:30:20,566 --> 01:30:22,666
There was a time when the world was good.

777
01:30:22,666 --> 01:30:23,766
Where it's not.

778
01:30:23,766 --> 01:30:26,699
There was a part of me that felt like I was on the right track.

779
01:30:26,699 --> 01:30:28,933
There's something amazing I can do.

780
01:30:28,933 --> 01:30:29,933
somehow or other

781
01:30:29,933 --> 01:30:33,933
It's like, if you use your head, it might be there.

782
01:30:33,933 --> 01:30:37,066
It was like a change of mindset.

783
01:30:37,066 --> 01:30:39,500
Even though I wasn't there.

784
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:41,666
It was amazing.

785
01:30:41,666 --> 01:30:43,566
Can I go home for a while or not?

786
01:30:43,566 --> 01:30:47,833
I've been looking at information in places like I don't know.

787
01:30:47,833 --> 01:30:49,366
All that time.

788
01:30:49,366 --> 01:30:53,600
You're looking at the Internet and wondering if you can do something.

789
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:55,066
Where people do this.

790
01:30:55,066 --> 01:30:57,333
I just wanted to see if I could do something.

791
01:30:57,333 --> 01:30:59,199
It's the only place I can be involved anymore.

792
01:30:59,199 --> 01:31:01,500
It's remote.

793
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:02,866
You were there yourself.

794
01:31:02,866 --> 01:31:04,033
So, Seki-san and the others.

795
01:31:04,033 --> 01:31:08,066
I've been watching the activities of

796
01:31:08,066 --> 01:31:11,866
And the facts that come out in those places.

797
01:31:11,866 --> 01:31:13,000
The media will bring it out.

798
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:16,633
It's not that the facts are different.

799
01:31:16,633 --> 01:31:20,066
There's a huge difference in temperature, isn't there?

800
01:31:20,066 --> 01:31:21,899
something like this there

801
01:31:21,899 --> 01:31:26,033
I had this feeling of bewilderment.

802
01:31:26,033 --> 01:31:30,233
So, like this, two computers and a TV.

803
01:31:30,233 --> 01:31:32,100
I got something for you from somewhere.

804
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:34,333
I asked the hotel staff to bring it to me.

805
01:31:34,333 --> 01:31:35,866
It's like another TV.

806
01:31:35,866 --> 01:31:38,100
I've been monitoring you.

807
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:40,666
Oh, I see.

808
01:31:40,666 --> 01:31:43,533
That's what I'm worried about when we're apart.

809
01:31:43,533 --> 01:31:46,366
I'm not sure which is true.

810
01:31:46,366 --> 01:31:48,133
I'm pretty sure that's what he's saying over here.

811
01:31:48,133 --> 01:31:49,866
I know it's true.

812
01:31:49,866 --> 01:31:52,566
Something about the death toll in the news in Japan.

813
01:31:52,566 --> 01:31:55,133
And it's not increasing at all.

814
01:31:55,133 --> 01:31:57,366
Some foreign media got it wrong.

815
01:31:57,366 --> 01:31:59,966
I don't know, like 8.1 on the Richter scale or something.

816
01:31:59,966 --> 01:32:00,666
Something like a million.

817
01:32:00,666 --> 01:32:02,733
The person who died.

818
01:32:02,733 --> 01:32:04,600
Something like M for million.

819
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,199
I introduced it in a way like that.

820
01:32:06,199 --> 01:32:08,300
It was a bit of a false alarm.

821
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:10,399
I wonder if I'll get one of those.

822
01:32:10,399 --> 01:32:14,633
When you're wondering what's going on and what's going on...

823
01:32:14,633 --> 01:32:16,300
Well, it's more like information.

824
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:19,000
Get it right, data as data.

825
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,033
I'm not sure if I'll be able to do it.

826
01:32:21,033 --> 01:32:24,199
It's so righteous.

827
01:32:24,199 --> 01:32:25,966
Something to give us data all the way up to that point.

828
01:32:25,966 --> 01:32:28,399
I've been mulling it over, wondering how it's going.

829
01:32:28,399 --> 01:32:31,199
I knew this was very true.

830
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:34,033
You need to get that data right.

831
01:32:34,033 --> 01:32:37,500
He said he'd put it out there for everyone to see.

832
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:39,766
You can't help but enter people's senses, can you?

833
01:32:39,766 --> 01:32:41,066
Like how you want it to look.

834
01:32:41,066 --> 01:32:43,166
I thought that was inevitable.

835
01:32:43,166 --> 01:32:44,733
I can't help it.

836
01:32:44,733 --> 01:32:47,600
How can we cut down on that?

837
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:49,300
He asked if I'd show him.

838
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:51,266
I think it's very important.

839
01:32:51,266 --> 01:32:53,666
I felt it so much at that time.

840
01:32:53,666 --> 01:32:55,033
Right.

841
01:32:55,033 --> 01:32:56,333
You know, we...

842
01:32:56,333 --> 01:32:57,833
What do I mean by open data?

843
01:32:57,833 --> 01:33:00,033
I knew I needed it.

844
01:33:00,033 --> 01:33:03,933
It was that "sinsai.info" of the Great East Japan Earthquake, wasn't it?

845
01:33:03,933 --> 01:33:05,166
say

846
01:33:05,166 --> 01:33:08,166
For example, we want to map the information of evacuation centers.

847
01:33:08,166 --> 01:33:10,399
I want to see where the shelters are.

848
01:33:10,399 --> 01:33:13,233
How many people have been evacuated?

849
01:33:13,233 --> 01:33:15,166
Everyone wanted to know.

850
01:33:15,166 --> 01:33:16,066
I'll tell you what.

851
01:33:16,066 --> 01:33:19,333
I was thinking of going to the shelter to get the data.

852
01:33:19,333 --> 01:33:22,000
So, no.

853
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,866
Even if it's on a website or something.

854
01:33:24,866 --> 01:33:26,800
Or maybe the address isn't listed properly.

855
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:30,866
Also, it's copywritten.

856
01:33:30,866 --> 01:33:32,766
I can't just copy it without permission.

857
01:33:32,766 --> 01:33:34,500
Can I post that as data?

858
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:36,633
And even if you talk to the local government about it.

859
01:33:36,633 --> 01:33:38,866
First of all, the phone was disconnected.

860
01:33:38,866 --> 01:33:40,033
Even if I could get through to him.

861
01:33:40,033 --> 01:33:42,933
I'm sorry about that.

862
01:33:42,933 --> 01:33:46,366
It's like using a tight phone line for a permit like this.

863
01:33:46,366 --> 01:33:48,633
But, well, there are people who need it.

864
01:33:48,633 --> 01:33:49,866
Like making a phone call.

865
01:33:49,866 --> 01:33:51,366
However, even if you ask me a question.

866
01:33:51,366 --> 01:33:53,233
They don't know what I'm talking about.

867
01:33:53,233 --> 01:33:55,133
So you can't answer.

868
01:33:55,133 --> 01:33:57,600
I don't even know who to call for confirmation.

869
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:58,433
I don't know what it is.

870
01:33:58,433 --> 01:33:59,766
They said no.

871
01:33:59,766 --> 01:34:02,266
I couldn't post it.

872
01:34:02,266 --> 01:34:04,066
This should be done in advance.

873
01:34:04,066 --> 01:34:07,100
If you could just remove that copyright.

874
01:34:07,100 --> 01:34:09,966
We can do whatever we want over there.

875
01:34:09,966 --> 01:34:11,000
It's out there.

876
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:11,199
(esp. of men) one's prime (approx. age 30)

877
01:34:11,199 --> 01:34:16,199
They think they're getting it, too.

878
01:34:16,199 --> 01:34:17,866
It's a combination of many things.

879
01:34:17,866 --> 01:34:18,333
of course

880
01:34:18,333 --> 01:34:21,500
Make sure you have the data right from the start.

881
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:24,666
It's important to be able to use them.

882
01:34:24,666 --> 01:34:27,433
That's what you do in an emergency.

883
01:34:27,433 --> 01:34:30,600
It's natural for them to be low on the priority list.

884
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:32,266
I guess I have to do it in peacetime.

885
01:34:32,266 --> 01:34:34,000
That's what I've learned.

886
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,633
That was a pretty big experience.

887
01:34:37,633 --> 01:34:40,666
When I made my first website in 1998 or so.

888
01:34:40,666 --> 01:34:43,100
Create a website for your area or something.

889
01:34:43,100 --> 01:34:45,366
There, you know, regardless of the local government.

890
01:34:45,366 --> 01:34:49,366
There's a lot of information out there, and I'm not even local.

891
01:34:49,366 --> 01:34:50,833
I was just trying to get some information.

892
01:34:50,833 --> 01:34:53,300
I think we can get that kind of information to the people we want.

893
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:54,066
I thought.

894
01:34:54,066 --> 01:34:57,699
Send an email to the various municipal neighborhoods.

895
01:34:57,699 --> 01:34:59,600
I asked him to give me the data.

896
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:00,800
That e-mail was posted on the wall.

897
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:02,300
The World

898
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:04,100
What do you mean?

899
01:35:04,100 --> 01:35:06,166
Something from this guy, with no name.

900
01:35:06,166 --> 01:35:09,633
He said it was extremely inappropriate to receive such an e-mail.

901
01:35:09,633 --> 01:35:11,433
Give me the data.

902
01:35:11,433 --> 01:35:14,500
It's like they're already sending me this stuff.

903
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:17,100
It's like there's some kind of crazy person out there.

904
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:21,733
The entrance to the city hall at the very beginning.

905
01:35:21,733 --> 01:35:25,766
Someone told me it was posted.

906
01:35:25,766 --> 01:35:27,466
Do the same thing with your website.

907
01:35:27,466 --> 01:35:29,033
You know, the guy who does the regional ones.

908
01:35:29,033 --> 01:35:30,833
There weren't many at the time.

909
01:35:30,833 --> 01:35:33,300
I can't believe I'm still making websites.

910
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:34,566
It was posted.

911
01:35:34,566 --> 01:35:36,866
Now that municipality is also using open data.

912
01:35:36,866 --> 01:35:42,133
I'm glad to hear you're doing so well.

913
01:35:42,133 --> 01:35:44,133
But it's not like that.

914
01:35:44,133 --> 01:35:46,833
Well, data is data.

915
01:35:46,833 --> 01:35:50,833
It's collected through taxes, and it belongs to the local government.

916
01:35:50,833 --> 01:35:52,466
So this is how it's going to go public.

917
01:35:52,466 --> 01:35:54,733
I've already published it as a website.

918
01:35:54,733 --> 01:35:56,366
I managed, though.

919
01:35:56,366 --> 01:35:58,633
That still needs to be protected.

920
01:35:58,633 --> 01:36:01,766
I've been thinking about this since the Great East Japan Earthquake.

921
01:36:01,766 --> 01:36:05,000
Even at times, you were still strong.

922
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,633
After all that...

923
01:36:06,633 --> 01:36:08,800
It's called open data promotion.

924
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:11,100
It became a national policy.

925
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:13,766
The Great East Japan Earthquake was a disaster for the country as well.

926
01:36:13,766 --> 01:36:15,899
It was really important for the release of such data.

927
01:36:15,899 --> 01:36:18,399
It's changed, hasn't it? From there.

928
01:36:18,399 --> 01:36:20,600
From that activity

929
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:23,166
In a place like Code for Japan launch.

930
01:36:23,166 --> 01:36:25,100
Are you going to move on in Seki-san's mind?

931
01:36:25,100 --> 01:36:26,666
That's right.

932
01:36:26,666 --> 01:36:30,233
I mean, it's like...

933
01:36:30,233 --> 01:36:31,233
You've used a lot of things.

934
01:36:31,233 --> 01:36:33,333
Its "sinsai.info" is

935
01:36:33,333 --> 01:36:34,433
oh dear!

936
01:36:34,433 --> 01:36:36,866
I got a few page views.

937
01:36:36,866 --> 01:36:41,233
The people who actually go on that volunteer trip.

938
01:36:41,233 --> 01:36:42,933
To get the information.

939
01:36:42,933 --> 01:36:44,733
You know, I can just about figure it out.

940
01:36:44,733 --> 01:36:45,633
Very useful.

941
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:47,533
I'm not sure.

942
01:36:47,533 --> 01:36:51,333
After all, there were those two things.

943
01:36:51,333 --> 01:36:52,666
One, as I said before.

944
01:36:52,666 --> 01:36:54,800
If we don't do it right in peacetime.

945
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:56,133
See you next time

946
01:36:56,133 --> 01:36:59,566
There's no point in doing the same thing from scratch.

947
01:36:59,566 --> 01:37:02,066
I know you will. You have to do it.

948
01:37:02,066 --> 01:37:06,100
It's the newspaper, isn't it?

949
01:37:06,100 --> 01:37:07,633
Some people like local media.

950
01:37:07,633 --> 01:37:10,166
I'm gathering a lot of great information.

951
01:37:10,166 --> 01:37:12,899
There are only a handful that make it to the paper.

952
01:37:12,899 --> 01:37:14,633
This information is a waste of time.

953
01:37:14,633 --> 01:37:16,833
I'd like to be able to share more of these things.

954
01:37:16,833 --> 01:37:17,733
Something like that.

955
01:37:17,733 --> 01:37:20,066
That's one of the things I was thinking at the time.

956
01:37:20,066 --> 01:37:23,066
I just want to make sure that information gets out there.

957
01:37:23,066 --> 01:37:26,100
The other is to begin with.

958
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:27,033
This technology

959
01:37:27,033 --> 01:37:28,600
What we've done...

960
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:30,933
I wonder how much of this really helped.

961
01:37:30,933 --> 01:37:34,233
Something like that.

962
01:37:34,233 --> 01:37:36,699
At least those who were there.

963
01:37:36,699 --> 01:37:40,466
I don't even have a phone.

964
01:37:40,466 --> 01:37:43,133
The Internet itself.

965
01:37:43,133 --> 01:37:44,533
Like, I can't get through.

966
01:37:44,533 --> 01:37:46,266
I was talking about something like no batteries.

967
01:37:46,266 --> 01:37:47,266
It didn't help, did it?

968
01:37:47,266 --> 01:37:49,000
There are stories like that.

969
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
And then, during the reconstruction period.

970
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,966
It's like, how can we use that little bit more technology?

971
01:37:53,966 --> 01:37:56,500
I wanted to help in some way.

972
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:58,399
That's why we have to make sure that we have the right technology.

973
01:37:58,399 --> 01:37:59,866
I want to use it. I want people to use it.

974
01:37:59,866 --> 01:38:02,199
Something like that.

975
01:38:02,199 --> 01:38:06,199
Well, actually, I happen to know some people who do.

976
01:38:06,199 --> 01:38:09,600
You said you had a chance to visit the site.

977
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:12,166
I think it was about a month after the earthquake.

978
01:38:12,166 --> 01:38:13,699
You've already been in many areas.

979
01:38:13,699 --> 01:38:15,100
Kamaishi.

980
01:38:15,100 --> 01:38:16,633
All kinds of things.

981
01:38:16,633 --> 01:38:18,899
It was a very tragic scene.

982
01:38:18,899 --> 01:38:19,199
say

983
01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:22,300
A month. It's hardly changed at all.

984
01:38:22,300 --> 01:38:23,966
So I was there.

985
01:38:23,966 --> 01:38:27,366
Most of the time, they say, these things are useless.

986
01:38:27,366 --> 01:38:31,066
Affected areas, especially the coastal areas on the front lines

987
01:38:31,066 --> 01:38:32,933
In places like...

988
01:38:32,933 --> 01:38:35,000
That car license is much more useful.

989
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:38,066
It's more than a technical thing.

990
01:38:38,066 --> 01:38:41,266
What is it that you need help with in the first place?

991
01:38:41,266 --> 01:38:42,233
I'll talk to him.

992
01:38:42,233 --> 01:38:45,066
There's no way I could have come up with that.

993
01:38:45,066 --> 01:38:45,766
Oh, my God.

994
01:38:45,766 --> 01:38:47,133
I don't understand what you're saying in the first place.

995
01:38:47,133 --> 01:38:49,100
It's like...

996
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:50,933
However, he said I should do this.

997
01:38:50,933 --> 01:38:56,366
I don't even have that knowledge of the field to speak of.

998
01:38:56,366 --> 01:38:59,300
I feel like I'm on the edge of my seat.

999
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:02,766
There's something I can do about all this.

1000
01:39:02,766 --> 01:39:06,433
But of course I can't do this on my own.

1001
01:39:06,433 --> 01:39:08,600
It's pretty hard to tell.

1002
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:10,833
I'm a little depressed.

1003
01:39:10,833 --> 01:39:16,466
Then I went to the volunteer center in the Tono area.

1004
01:39:16,466 --> 01:39:19,566
It's a relatively big place.

1005
01:39:19,566 --> 01:39:22,033
Everyone stays there for a night and then

1006
01:39:22,033 --> 01:39:25,466
Places like going to the affected coastal areas of each region.

1007
01:39:25,466 --> 01:39:28,666
And you're the head of the center there.

1008
01:39:28,666 --> 01:39:29,733
What I want to do with IT

1009
01:39:29,733 --> 01:39:33,266
There are so many!You said.

1010
01:39:33,266 --> 01:39:34,033
So it actually happened.

1011
01:39:34,033 --> 01:39:35,533
I'll have to manage reception and stuff.

1012
01:39:35,533 --> 01:39:38,233
Something about how hard it is to do in Excel.

1013
01:39:38,233 --> 01:39:39,766
You want to make your website better.

1014
01:39:39,766 --> 01:39:42,666
Something about a guy cleaning photos.

1015
01:39:42,666 --> 01:39:44,766
You want to make it easy to find out what you're doing.

1016
01:39:44,766 --> 01:39:47,500
I could think of a lot of things to do.

1017
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:49,199
In fact, do something like a hackathon.

1018
01:39:49,199 --> 01:39:50,933
Like making prototypes and stuff.

1019
01:39:50,933 --> 01:39:54,066
I'm glad you liked it.

1020
01:39:54,066 --> 01:39:57,833
I felt like I was being saved.

1021
01:39:57,833 --> 01:40:00,433
I don't know what it is with these sites.

1022
01:40:00,433 --> 01:40:03,566
People who can bridge the gap between people who understand technology

1023
01:40:03,566 --> 01:40:06,333
You don't have to be very knowledgeable about it.

1024
01:40:06,333 --> 01:40:08,899
Someone who says, "I have a lot of work to do.

1025
01:40:08,899 --> 01:40:11,266
I thought it was really important.

1026
01:40:11,266 --> 01:40:14,333
We really need people like this.

1027
01:40:14,333 --> 01:40:16,933
There's something that can stand between us.

1028
01:40:16,933 --> 01:40:19,133
I thought it would be nice if I could do that.

1029
01:40:19,133 --> 01:40:23,000
Well, I've been there and done that.

1030
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:25,300
I was just growing out of it.

1031
01:40:25,300 --> 01:40:26,633
So...

1032
01:40:26,633 --> 01:40:29,666
But I still don't know how to do it.

1033
01:40:29,666 --> 01:40:31,466
He said he wanted to do something like that.

1034
01:40:31,466 --> 01:40:34,666
All I had was a fuzzy feeling.

1035
01:40:34,666 --> 01:40:37,133
Founder of Code for America

1036
01:40:37,133 --> 01:40:38,733
By Jennifer Pahlka.

1037
01:40:38,733 --> 01:40:42,100
I've published a TED Talk.

1038
01:40:42,100 --> 01:40:44,300
That was in 2012.

1039
01:40:44,300 --> 01:40:48,266
You had a great flash of inspiration when you saw that.

1040
01:40:48,266 --> 01:40:50,800
I thought it might be fun to do this in Japan.

1041
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:53,800
Something about sending that engineer to the government.

1042
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:55,600
Maybe do some prototyping.

1043
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:57,199
Creating a local community.

1044
01:40:57,199 --> 01:41:00,266
It's something I can understand.

1045
01:41:00,266 --> 01:41:02,399
You're talking about a lot of things that could be done.

1046
01:41:02,399 --> 01:41:03,966
if it comes to that

1047
01:41:03,966 --> 01:41:05,633
I wanted to try it in Japan.

1048
01:41:05,633 --> 01:41:07,533
He said he started Code for Japan.

1049
01:41:07,533 --> 01:41:09,000
Flow.

1050
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:13,699
The earthquake was a very big trigger for that.

1051
01:41:13,699 --> 01:41:14,666
I wonder if

1052
01:41:14,666 --> 01:41:17,766
I don't know if I've ever heard of open data before.

1053
01:41:17,766 --> 01:41:19,399
It also conference in 2010

1054
01:41:19,399 --> 01:41:21,233
When I went to London.

1055
01:41:21,233 --> 01:41:22,966
I'm sure there's something between open source people and

1056
01:41:22,966 --> 01:41:25,033
Maybe he's involved in open data.

1057
01:41:25,033 --> 01:41:28,033
I'm working on that separately.

1058
01:41:28,033 --> 01:41:30,366
I'm working on that open source and doing that too.

1059
01:41:30,366 --> 01:41:32,100
I had a lot of things like that.

1060
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:33,466
He invited me over quite a bit.

1061
01:41:33,466 --> 01:41:35,566
Do you have any plans after this?

1062
01:41:35,566 --> 01:41:36,566
Open data

1063
01:41:36,566 --> 01:41:37,266
I don't know.

1064
01:41:37,266 --> 01:41:39,333
I have a little community thing.

1065
01:41:39,333 --> 01:41:44,233
I was like, "What is that?" and the more I heard about it, the more I listened.

1066
01:41:44,233 --> 01:41:47,466
Oh, like it's never going to happen in Japan.

1067
01:41:47,466 --> 01:41:51,766
The idea is that you're in open source.

1068
01:41:51,766 --> 01:41:52,766
Just say it.

1069
01:41:52,766 --> 01:41:55,199
It's still not accepted in Japan.

1070
01:41:55,199 --> 01:41:57,533
But the idea is that it's rational.

1071
01:41:57,533 --> 01:42:00,133
I think I have a great base.

1072
01:42:00,133 --> 01:42:01,833
That rational thinking.

1073
01:42:01,833 --> 01:42:03,866
In the first place, in Japan, it is somewhat

1074
01:42:03,866 --> 01:42:05,133
It's not that I can't accept it.

1075
01:42:05,133 --> 01:42:06,733
Especially at work, if you're rational about it.

1076
01:42:06,733 --> 01:42:09,033
You can't take money, and all that.

1077
01:42:09,033 --> 01:42:11,199
In the engineering world, there were things like that.

1078
01:42:11,199 --> 01:42:13,333
I was wondering if it would be difficult.

1079
01:42:13,333 --> 01:42:15,800
Here comes something like open data again.

1080
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:16,399
But then...

1081
01:42:16,399 --> 01:42:19,066
London has had a rough time of it.

1082
01:42:19,066 --> 01:42:21,433
We've got to take care of ourselves.

1083
01:42:21,433 --> 01:42:21,733
step

1084
01:42:21,733 --> 01:42:22,866
That kind of movement?

1085
01:42:22,866 --> 01:42:25,033
When there's a problem.

1086
01:42:25,033 --> 01:42:27,433
I knew I couldn't be like this anymore.

1087
01:42:27,433 --> 01:42:29,466
I thought it was easy to get up.

1088
01:42:29,466 --> 01:42:31,566
I wondered what it would be like in Japan.

1089
01:42:31,566 --> 01:42:33,266
In 2010

1090
01:42:33,266 --> 01:42:35,033
I'm really thinking about it.

1091
01:42:35,033 --> 01:42:37,566
But that was then.

1092
01:42:37,566 --> 01:42:39,899
From a friend in that Perl community.

1093
01:42:39,899 --> 01:42:42,133
I'm afraid I can't make myself available for a moment.

1094
01:42:42,133 --> 01:42:44,600
I have friends coming from Taiwan.

1095
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:46,933
He asked me to show him around Kyoto.

1096
01:42:46,933 --> 01:42:48,233
I don't even speak that kind of English.

1097
01:42:48,233 --> 01:42:52,233
Oh, no, I'd rather show you around on my own without you.

1098
01:42:52,233 --> 01:42:54,366
If you say so, that's the G0v (Gab Zero).

1099
01:42:54,366 --> 01:42:56,500
The founding member.

1100
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:57,800
CL Kao (Chia Lian Kao, Gao Jialiang)?

1101
01:42:57,800 --> 01:42:58,399
or thereabouts

1102
01:42:58,399 --> 01:42:59,966
Like Audrey Tan (Tang Feng).

1103
01:42:59,966 --> 01:43:02,566
It wasn't like Audri or anything then.

1104
01:43:02,566 --> 01:43:04,333
I don't know.

1105
01:43:04,333 --> 01:43:05,566
And there again.

1106
01:43:05,566 --> 01:43:06,800
Open data.

1107
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:09,166
We were talking about civic tech.

1108
01:43:09,166 --> 01:43:10,500
Something like that.

1109
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:13,133
He said that the people who are trying to do this are all around him.

1110
01:43:13,133 --> 01:43:14,933
But I guess there are a lot of engineers.

1111
01:43:14,933 --> 01:43:16,933
If you say something like.

1112
01:43:16,933 --> 01:43:19,666
Well, we were here as a couple.

1113
01:43:19,666 --> 01:43:21,666
The engineer is your husband, the engineer.

1114
01:43:21,666 --> 01:43:23,666
His wife was a journalist.

1115
01:43:23,666 --> 01:43:25,600
And something about Taiwan.

1116
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:27,600
There's a lot of people involved.

1117
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:28,833
Civic tech.

1118
01:43:28,833 --> 01:43:31,699
I thought Japan wasn't like that.

1119
01:43:31,699 --> 01:43:33,100
Even if you're not an engineer.

1120
01:43:33,100 --> 01:43:35,000
There's so much I can do.

1121
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,933
That those people will move it.

1122
01:43:36,933 --> 01:43:39,233
They said, "Because it's there.

1123
01:43:39,233 --> 01:43:41,166
something or other

1124
01:43:41,166 --> 01:43:43,366
I wonder if that's how it's going to be.

1125
01:43:43,366 --> 01:43:44,899
I don't know.

1126
01:43:44,899 --> 01:43:46,366
While we are in an open source world.

1127
01:43:46,366 --> 01:43:48,866
We're going to make open data out of data that we've created somehow.

1128
01:43:48,866 --> 01:43:49,666
Wait a minute.

1129
01:43:49,666 --> 01:43:50,633
Like.

1130
01:43:50,633 --> 01:43:52,466
But moving on...

1131
01:43:52,466 --> 01:43:54,733
I'm sure data is absolutely important now.

1132
01:43:54,733 --> 01:43:55,000
called

1133
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,633
A lot of things that were bothering me...

1134
01:43:57,633 --> 01:44:01,399
There's something that's been leading me there.

1135
01:44:01,399 --> 01:44:02,766
or perhaps I should say

1136
01:44:02,766 --> 01:44:04,166
I'm not sure.

1137
01:44:04,166 --> 01:44:07,500
That's the way we have to think from now on.

1138
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:09,866
I don't think I'll be able to keep up.

1139
01:44:09,866 --> 01:44:11,566
As a great sense of urgency.

1140
01:44:11,566 --> 01:44:12,399
such was the case

1141
01:44:12,399 --> 01:44:12,866
There was, but...

1142
01:44:12,866 --> 01:44:15,866
I'm not sure what it takes to change something like that.

1143
01:44:15,866 --> 01:44:18,399
I don't really have it in me.

1144
01:44:18,399 --> 01:44:20,600
I'm sure you've heard of such disasters.

1145
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:22,233
I don't know what happened.

1146
01:44:22,233 --> 01:44:22,899
Among Seki's

1147
01:44:22,899 --> 01:44:24,899
Was it very big?

1148
01:44:24,899 --> 01:44:27,033
Yes, of course.

1149
01:44:27,033 --> 01:44:27,666
If not for the earthquake

1150
01:44:27,666 --> 01:44:30,766
I'm probably not doing this.

1151
01:44:30,766 --> 01:44:32,699
Startup people

1152
01:44:32,699 --> 01:44:35,333
So he was a start-up guy.

1153
01:44:35,333 --> 01:44:36,666
if I had to say then

1154
01:44:36,666 --> 01:44:39,066
Overseas oriented.

1155
01:44:39,066 --> 01:44:42,633
He was happy to work abroad.

1156
01:44:42,633 --> 01:44:48,766
Now I see. In that sense, it's very domestic.

1157
01:44:48,766 --> 01:44:51,766
I tried my best to study English, but...

1158
01:44:51,766 --> 01:44:52,666
Not now.

1159
01:44:52,666 --> 01:44:56,366
I don't think I want to work abroad.

1160
01:44:56,366 --> 01:44:58,300
It's also a global place in a different way.

1161
01:44:58,300 --> 01:45:00,633
We can get involved, right?

1162
01:45:00,633 --> 01:45:01,766
In those days, you'd go over there.

1163
01:45:01,766 --> 01:45:03,033
For example, working.

1164
01:45:03,033 --> 01:45:04,333
So that's what you've been doing.

1165
01:45:04,333 --> 01:45:06,933
I see.

1166
01:45:06,933 --> 01:45:09,399
But so is the Corona this time.

1167
01:45:09,399 --> 01:45:11,800
I knew that crisis would happen.

1168
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:14,300
That civic tech stuff is great.

1169
01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:16,399
He's very active.

1170
01:45:16,399 --> 01:45:20,666
Society itself needs to change.

1171
01:45:20,666 --> 01:45:22,766
That's the direction I'm going.

1172
01:45:22,766 --> 01:45:26,600
And this time, too, we'll have a digital agency.

1173
01:45:26,600 --> 01:45:30,000
I've been to the Code for Japan Summit before.

1174
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,766
Get him on the morning show or something.

1175
01:45:32,766 --> 01:45:35,333
When we change the country.

1176
01:45:35,333 --> 01:45:37,100
The country will change.

1177
01:45:37,100 --> 01:45:38,100
Or maybe...

1178
01:45:38,100 --> 01:45:39,933
Is it possible to change things from the local level?

1179
01:45:39,933 --> 01:45:42,566
I gave a talk on the subject.

1180
01:45:42,566 --> 01:45:46,800
I don't know... I was just thinking about that theme at the time.

1181
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:48,733
That's how the government works.

1182
01:45:48,733 --> 01:45:49,666
Local government.

1183
01:45:49,666 --> 01:45:51,466
Some of the people who were involved in the project came to see me.

1184
01:45:51,466 --> 01:45:53,000
That's the theme I had in mind.

1185
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:54,933
I think it's something more in between.

1186
01:45:54,933 --> 01:45:57,199
That's what I'm thinking.

1187
01:45:57,199 --> 01:45:58,899
People who connect there

1188
01:45:58,899 --> 01:46:00,199
I'm like this.

1189
01:46:00,199 --> 01:46:02,933
Well, in a slightly neutral way.

1190
01:46:02,933 --> 01:46:05,266
I don't know if it's something the government wants me to do or not.

1191
01:46:05,266 --> 01:46:07,500
I've been working in a different area than my main business.

1192
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:08,566
I do.

1193
01:46:08,566 --> 01:46:11,733
I knew what I had to do in the middle.

1194
01:46:11,733 --> 01:46:13,266
There's a limit to what I can do.

1195
01:46:13,266 --> 01:46:16,433
I'm just halfway through my training.

1196
01:46:16,433 --> 01:46:18,199
I wish I could do more for you after this.

1197
01:46:18,199 --> 01:46:21,366
It's not easy to do it there.

1198
01:46:21,366 --> 01:46:23,333
I'm not sure I'd do that in my day job.

1199
01:46:23,333 --> 01:46:25,800
I'm not sure if it's a budget issue or not.

1200
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:27,266
You want me to do that on my own?

1201
01:46:27,266 --> 01:46:29,333
I hear it's different if you volunteer to do it.

1202
01:46:29,333 --> 01:46:31,266
I'm kind of stuck here.

1203
01:46:31,266 --> 01:46:32,500
in some respects

1204
01:46:32,500 --> 01:46:35,333
But at times like that, Code Four, it's like...

1205
01:46:35,333 --> 01:46:37,800
This is how it should look.

1206
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:40,300
Just neutralize it there.

1207
01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:41,466
For example, if you take a job.

1208
01:46:41,466 --> 01:46:42,766
I knew you'd be working with 100%.

1209
01:46:42,766 --> 01:46:45,233
I'm asked to do these things.

1210
01:46:45,233 --> 01:46:46,899
In an activity called Code Four.

1211
01:46:46,899 --> 01:46:48,300
Then you do a little of this.

1212
01:46:48,300 --> 01:46:49,766
I'm gonna do a little of this.

1213
01:46:49,766 --> 01:46:53,033
I'd like to know what you think.

1214
01:46:53,033 --> 01:46:54,966
Bring it up and then have it take shape.

1215
01:46:54,966 --> 01:46:55,966
By the way, Code for Japan

1216
01:46:55,966 --> 01:46:57,533
Something like that.

1217
01:46:57,533 --> 01:46:58,699
I knew you'd bring it up.

1218
01:46:58,699 --> 01:47:00,133
Everyone brings their own.

1219
01:47:00,133 --> 01:47:03,733
It's not always easy to make that happen.

1220
01:47:03,733 --> 01:47:05,600
If it was in front of somewhere else.

1221
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:07,566
SIers and the like.

1222
01:47:07,566 --> 01:47:08,566
Maybe they were pulling him up.

1223
01:47:08,566 --> 01:47:09,199
I don't know.

1224
01:47:09,199 --> 01:47:11,533
Something different about that too.

1225
01:47:11,533 --> 01:47:16,833
There's something a little more neutral in there too, something that's not governmental.

1226
01:47:16,833 --> 01:47:18,466
And not just citizens.

1227
01:47:18,466 --> 01:47:21,699
I'm hoping that these people will do something for me.

1228
01:47:21,699 --> 01:47:24,966
Surprisingly, that's where the cell will turn.

1229
01:47:24,966 --> 01:47:27,533
I don't know if I'm in the right place.

1230
01:47:27,533 --> 01:47:29,433
I just kind of took it.

1231
01:47:29,433 --> 01:47:31,233
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do on my own.

1232
01:47:31,233 --> 01:47:32,933
There are some parts that are like that.

1233
01:47:32,933 --> 01:47:35,399
I've been working with Code for Kyoto (Kyoto) and others.

1234
01:47:35,399 --> 01:47:37,633
This is my job.

1235
01:47:37,633 --> 01:47:39,666
Something about going this far.

1236
01:47:39,666 --> 01:47:41,266
I wish I could do my job and do it right.

1237
01:47:41,266 --> 01:47:43,033
I don't know... I can't do it.

1238
01:47:43,033 --> 01:47:45,766
That kind of vagueness...

1239
01:47:45,766 --> 01:47:50,166
When I got involved in Code for Japan, I felt like

1240
01:47:50,166 --> 01:47:51,133
would you say?

1241
01:47:51,133 --> 01:47:53,433
That's what we're trying to do.

1242
01:47:53,433 --> 01:47:55,399
I'm wondering if there is.

1243
01:47:55,399 --> 01:47:56,066
if that's the case

1244
01:47:56,066 --> 01:47:57,600
Code for Japan and Kyoto (Code for Kyoto)

1245
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:00,666
It's not like we're in the same position again.

1246
01:48:00,666 --> 01:48:02,166
And I'm getting a lot of stuff.

1247
01:48:02,166 --> 01:48:06,066
But I think Code for Japan is the way to go.

1248
01:48:06,066 --> 01:48:07,533
I don't know. This one here and this one there.

1249
01:48:07,533 --> 01:48:08,899
There are places we can go.

1250
01:48:08,899 --> 01:48:10,233
Or maybe not.

1251
01:48:10,233 --> 01:48:12,699
I feel like it's changing shape.

1252
01:48:12,699 --> 01:48:16,766
Yes, I've been feeling that way a lot lately.

1253
01:48:16,766 --> 01:48:19,066
It's really early days now.

1254
01:48:19,066 --> 01:48:23,366
So it was like an open source community.

1255
01:48:23,366 --> 01:48:25,466
It's really grassroots.

1256
01:48:25,466 --> 01:48:28,300
I'm going to do what all those people want to do.

1257
01:48:28,300 --> 01:48:32,800
And that's how wisdom is shared.

1258
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:34,100
I hear it's getting better.

1259
01:48:34,100 --> 01:48:35,100
Of course, anything made with

1260
01:48:35,100 --> 01:48:36,100
Release it as open source.

1261
01:48:36,100 --> 01:48:37,800
It looks like other people use it.

1262
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:39,966
But it's not the only solution.

1263
01:48:39,966 --> 01:48:41,366
There are so many of them.

1264
01:48:41,366 --> 01:48:44,766
When it comes to changing the system like this...

1265
01:48:44,766 --> 01:48:46,633
doing something in a roundabout way

1266
01:48:46,633 --> 01:48:50,300
With the resources we have.

1267
01:48:50,300 --> 01:48:51,966
The things that we need to do...

1268
01:48:51,966 --> 01:48:52,966
a lot

1269
01:48:52,966 --> 01:48:54,066
I know you have.

1270
01:48:54,066 --> 01:48:56,866
And that's what I'm talking about.

1271
01:48:56,866 --> 01:48:59,666
There are areas where economic rationality alone is not enough.

1272
01:48:59,666 --> 01:49:01,766
There are a lot of them, and there's

1273
01:49:01,766 --> 01:49:05,966
The existence of Code for Japan is

1274
01:49:05,966 --> 01:49:06,933
little by little like this

1275
01:49:06,933 --> 01:49:09,100
Support those areas.

1276
01:49:09,100 --> 01:49:10,966
I wonder if it's becoming something like that.

1277
01:49:10,966 --> 01:49:11,666
I've been thinking.

1278
01:49:11,666 --> 01:49:14,133
For example, in the beginning.

1279
01:49:14,133 --> 01:49:15,866
Maybe I did last year.

1280
01:49:15,866 --> 01:49:19,433
The Tokyo Metropolitan Government's new corona infection countermeasure website

1281
01:49:19,433 --> 01:49:20,666
Well, I'm still working on it.

1282
01:49:20,666 --> 01:49:22,766
You couldn't have done something like that.

1283
01:49:22,766 --> 01:49:26,300
That's a job that I'm being paid to do.

1284
01:49:26,300 --> 01:49:27,866
But at a regular vendor.

1285
01:49:27,866 --> 01:49:30,433
I'm doing something that's not easy to do.

1286
01:49:30,433 --> 01:49:32,166
Something like that.

1287
01:49:32,166 --> 01:49:35,966
I'm sure it's a big part of his existence.

1288
01:49:35,966 --> 01:49:38,399
Yeah, I know. It's like...

1289
01:49:38,399 --> 01:49:40,399
You're going to be like Mr. SIer.

1290
01:49:40,399 --> 01:49:42,833
You have a little civic tech expert there.

1291
01:49:42,833 --> 01:49:44,066
or something, maybe.

1292
01:49:44,066 --> 01:49:45,899
As for the various paths.

1293
01:49:45,899 --> 01:49:48,399
I'm sure they'll find a way to make it work.

1294
01:49:48,399 --> 01:49:50,766
It's not like I'm going to be a regular SIer.

1295
01:49:50,766 --> 01:49:51,699
I know I'm not the only one who thinks so.

1296
01:49:51,699 --> 01:49:52,899
That's not funny.

1297
01:49:52,899 --> 01:49:54,833
I think so, and I don't.

1298
01:49:54,833 --> 01:49:58,066
I'd like to be in some kind of position.

1299
01:49:58,066 --> 01:50:00,066
Because it's already got a scale to it.

1300
01:50:00,066 --> 01:50:03,800
They already have a role to play in this.

1301
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:06,533
It's not the same as that.

1302
01:50:06,533 --> 01:50:08,399
I guess that's what I'm aiming for.

1303
01:50:08,399 --> 01:50:08,600
Of course.

1304
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:10,899
What do you think Code for Japan should be?

1305
01:50:10,899 --> 01:50:13,166
It's something I want to work towards.

1306
01:50:13,166 --> 01:50:15,699
It doesn't make sense to do something that can be done in a normal company.

1307
01:50:15,699 --> 01:50:18,233
Well, for example, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government's website.

1308
01:50:18,233 --> 01:50:20,699
If you can find another place to take over.

1309
01:50:20,699 --> 01:50:21,566
if it exists

1310
01:50:21,566 --> 01:50:23,300
It's like you're handing it off and on.

1311
01:50:23,300 --> 01:50:25,199
I think it is.

1312
01:50:25,199 --> 01:50:26,066
And now...

1313
01:50:26,066 --> 01:50:28,033
This is what I'm focusing on.

1314
01:50:28,033 --> 01:50:30,600
It's not just about economic rationality, as I mentioned earlier.

1315
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:31,399
Mutual aid.

1316
01:50:31,399 --> 01:50:32,899
For those parts.

1317
01:50:32,899 --> 01:50:35,000
I'm talking about building a system that works.

1318
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:38,766
I also think that doing what you want to do is the most important thing.

1319
01:50:38,766 --> 01:50:41,366
And it's the most fun.

1320
01:50:41,366 --> 01:50:43,866
It's about creating value for society.

1321
01:50:43,866 --> 01:50:46,133
It's in good condition.

1322
01:50:46,133 --> 01:50:47,199
Nothing like that.

1323
01:50:47,199 --> 01:50:48,699
That so-called GDP.

1324
01:50:48,699 --> 01:50:51,533
I don't use that as an indicator.

1325
01:50:51,533 --> 01:50:55,899
In that community, that's what I want to do, that's what I want to do.

1326
01:50:55,899 --> 01:50:57,866
Like, it's so much fun to do this.

1327
01:50:57,866 --> 01:51:00,066
can do each of the following

1328
01:51:00,066 --> 01:51:02,300
And it was well received.

1329
01:51:02,300 --> 01:51:05,466
And as a result, other people will be happy, too.

1330
01:51:05,466 --> 01:51:09,833
That cycle, the cycle that generates that value.

1331
01:51:09,833 --> 01:51:11,766
It's the birth of something like that.

1332
01:51:11,766 --> 01:51:14,533
I just thought it was really important.

1333
01:51:14,533 --> 01:51:16,399
In order to create such an environment

1334
01:51:16,399 --> 01:51:17,100
I knew that the local government

1335
01:51:17,100 --> 01:51:19,133
We have to change the way we are.

1336
01:51:19,133 --> 01:51:22,966
You know, it's something to start with, something to work with.

1337
01:51:22,966 --> 01:51:24,633
I need to hire more people.

1338
01:51:24,633 --> 01:51:26,233
Those areas.

1339
01:51:26,233 --> 01:51:29,166
Code for Kyoto (Kyoto) is also a good example.

1340
01:51:29,166 --> 01:51:32,300
I've been working with a lot of people.

1341
01:51:32,300 --> 01:51:33,733
That kind of

1342
01:51:33,733 --> 01:51:36,066
Something like a society of hands on work.

1343
01:51:36,066 --> 01:51:37,866
As a community well

1344
01:51:37,866 --> 01:51:38,899
I'll make it again.

1345
01:51:38,899 --> 01:51:39,966
For that

1346
01:51:39,966 --> 01:51:42,500
For parts that require some resources.

1347
01:51:42,500 --> 01:51:43,566
Code for Japan also

1348
01:51:43,566 --> 01:51:46,966
We're going to support them in various ways.

1349
01:51:46,966 --> 01:51:48,733
I'd like to do more and more experiments like that.

1350
01:51:48,733 --> 01:51:49,633
I've been thinking.

1351
01:51:49,633 --> 01:51:50,933
Code for Japan has just started.

1352
01:51:50,933 --> 01:51:52,966
I'm working on something called the DIY City Project.

1353
01:51:52,966 --> 01:51:54,033
And that's exactly what it is.

1354
01:51:54,033 --> 01:52:00,300
It's not about DIY, convenient, smart cities.

1355
01:52:00,300 --> 01:52:05,066
Not a society that pursues convenience and efficiency.

1356
01:52:05,066 --> 01:52:10,533
How rich the region is, how rich the culture is.

1357
01:52:10,533 --> 01:52:12,699
To creating it.

1358
01:52:12,699 --> 01:52:15,166
Citizens have a great hand in this.

1359
01:52:15,166 --> 01:52:18,166
Like, are you getting paid for it?

1360
01:52:18,166 --> 01:52:19,066
That's what's important.

1361
01:52:19,066 --> 01:52:20,566
Set KPIs like this first

1362
01:52:20,566 --> 01:52:22,699
Create KPIs for abundance.

1363
01:52:22,699 --> 01:52:25,233
After that, it's just a matter of moving your hands.

1364
01:52:25,233 --> 01:52:27,199
Or being evaluated.

1365
01:52:27,199 --> 01:52:28,733
To move those hands.

1366
01:52:28,733 --> 01:52:30,566
I'm calling it a DIY toolkit.

1367
01:52:30,566 --> 01:52:32,733
Let's make more and more of those weapons.

1368
01:52:32,733 --> 01:52:35,166
I mean, I'm working on it.

1369
01:52:35,166 --> 01:52:37,166
In many ways, the areas that we will focus on in the future are

1370
01:52:37,166 --> 01:52:40,033
Although its called a DIY city project.

1371
01:52:40,033 --> 01:52:42,000
Maybe you can be a little more specific.

1372
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:45,466
The idea is to work together in various areas.

1373
01:52:45,466 --> 01:52:49,333
That's where I want to come from.

1374
01:52:49,333 --> 01:52:51,166
I may have said a few words at that time.

1375
01:52:51,166 --> 01:52:53,666
When I was really young, I was kind of...

1376
01:52:53,666 --> 01:52:56,433
I'm talking about the marketing job sector.

1377
01:52:56,433 --> 01:52:58,533
I've been working as some kind of assistant.

1378
01:52:58,533 --> 01:53:01,000
And then, well...

1379
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:02,566
To study together.

1380
01:53:02,566 --> 01:53:04,366
He told me to do it with him.

1381
01:53:04,366 --> 01:53:05,866
What kind of town would be ideal?

1382
01:53:05,866 --> 01:53:07,800
That's what they made me write.

1383
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:10,266
Figure it out, or rather, draw it out.

1384
01:53:10,266 --> 01:53:15,699
My painting had only economic rationality.

1385
01:53:15,699 --> 01:53:20,100
The only things that exist in this city are things that make us productive.

1386
01:53:20,100 --> 01:53:21,433
Look at that.

1387
01:53:21,433 --> 01:53:23,266
Well, it's more culture.

1388
01:53:23,266 --> 01:53:26,266
Education is the key to the development of a city.

1389
01:53:26,266 --> 01:53:27,833
It's very important.

1390
01:53:27,833 --> 01:53:31,199
We need to have more of that perspective.

1391
01:53:31,199 --> 01:53:33,333
He told me I was making a mistake.

1392
01:53:33,333 --> 01:53:37,266
He was a senior I really disliked.

1393
01:53:37,266 --> 01:53:39,833
I don't know if that's what he said to me.

1394
01:53:39,833 --> 01:53:41,066
I learned a lot, I guess.

1395
01:53:41,066 --> 01:53:44,600
It's one word that I still remember.

1396
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:46,366
When I think about something.

1397
01:53:46,366 --> 01:53:48,233
In my case, I just couldn't help myself.

1398
01:53:48,233 --> 01:53:50,399
Or when I'm working on a proposal or something.

1399
01:53:50,399 --> 01:53:52,866
It's easier to understand if you say something about that KPI.

1400
01:53:52,866 --> 01:53:54,733
I've been to those places.

1401
01:53:54,733 --> 01:53:55,899
But I want to.

1402
01:53:55,899 --> 01:53:58,766
What I originally wanted to plan and do?

1403
01:53:58,766 --> 01:54:00,466
That's not what I'm talking about.

1404
01:54:00,466 --> 01:54:01,600
I'll drop something into the document.

1405
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:02,300
That's what happened.

1406
01:54:02,300 --> 01:54:03,133
What's so interesting about that?

1407
01:54:03,133 --> 01:54:05,133
When you feel like you've disappeared somewhere...

1408
01:54:05,133 --> 01:54:07,833
That's usually what's involved.

1409
01:54:07,833 --> 01:54:08,466
Oh, my God. Like this.

1410
01:54:08,466 --> 01:54:11,533
It's a word I'm aware of.

1411
01:54:11,533 --> 01:54:14,100
There's something about the richness of DIY cities.

1412
01:54:14,100 --> 01:54:16,233
I don't know if that's the kind of place that would come in.

1413
01:54:16,233 --> 01:54:18,633
Until now, it's just been this stuff that Seki-san writes.

1414
01:54:18,633 --> 01:54:19,633
And I've seen it.

1415
01:54:19,633 --> 01:54:20,766
I didn't know much.

1416
01:54:20,766 --> 01:54:22,333
Oh, yeah. Too bad.

1417
01:54:22,333 --> 01:54:24,266
I don't know, I'm more of a...

1418
01:54:24,266 --> 01:54:25,933
Mr. Seki said

1419
01:54:25,933 --> 01:54:28,100
In Japan... open source...

1420
01:54:28,100 --> 01:54:29,666
I was just saying something.

1421
01:54:29,666 --> 01:54:31,133
I've heard that you should volunteer.

1422
01:54:31,133 --> 01:54:33,933
I don't know if I should be getting paid or not.

1423
01:54:33,933 --> 01:54:35,966
You know, they can go off on crazy tangents.

1424
01:54:35,966 --> 01:54:36,866
But overseas.

1425
01:54:36,866 --> 01:54:39,300
In America, for example.

1426
01:54:39,300 --> 01:54:40,433
You have the money over here.

1427
01:54:40,433 --> 01:54:42,833
We have that kind of service mentality.

1428
01:54:42,833 --> 01:54:44,199
That's a good balance.

1429
01:54:44,199 --> 01:54:45,333
Hold something.

1430
01:54:45,333 --> 01:54:47,266
I'm just trying to do the right thing while doing the right thing.

1431
01:54:47,266 --> 01:54:49,300
Like I'm making money.

1432
01:54:49,300 --> 01:54:50,600
Something like this.

1433
01:54:50,600 --> 01:54:52,899
I thought it was really rare in Japan.

1434
01:54:52,899 --> 01:54:56,466
That's how I feel about you, Seki-san.

1435
01:54:56,466 --> 01:54:59,899
The only reason I can say this is because there's another company.

1436
01:54:59,899 --> 01:55:02,966
I've got that life under control.

1437
01:55:02,966 --> 01:55:06,966
Of course, it is important to be able to live properly.

1438
01:55:06,966 --> 01:55:08,166
I don't know.

1439
01:55:08,166 --> 01:55:10,433
This is what it takes to do this.

1440
01:55:10,433 --> 01:55:12,966
I'd have to say something.

1441
01:55:12,966 --> 01:55:14,233
Of course you're in a position of authority.

1442
01:55:14,233 --> 01:55:16,966
I'm in a position where I have to say that.

1443
01:55:16,966 --> 01:55:19,133
I don't know, it's like that for me too.

1444
01:55:19,133 --> 01:55:20,500
When you're doing something good.

1445
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:22,800
Something about money and stuff like that.

1446
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:25,199
I just want to go there without doing anything.

1447
01:55:25,199 --> 01:55:27,433
But see, I'm doing such a good job.

1448
01:55:27,433 --> 01:55:29,266
I'll make sure you get this much.

1449
01:55:29,266 --> 01:55:32,533
Like, you're thinking of giving it to him, too.

1450
01:55:32,533 --> 01:55:34,566
It's like you're reading the air.

1451
01:55:34,566 --> 01:55:35,666
It's like...

1452
01:55:35,666 --> 01:55:37,966
I can't always say it right.

1453
01:55:37,966 --> 01:55:40,366
But that place is open source.

1454
01:55:40,366 --> 01:55:42,533
And it's not like that.

1455
01:55:42,533 --> 01:55:44,500
I'm using something that's licensed.

1456
01:55:44,500 --> 01:55:45,766
There money is expensive.

1457
01:55:45,766 --> 01:55:46,933
And I don't mean

1458
01:55:46,933 --> 01:55:50,333
I have to juggle something.

1459
01:55:50,333 --> 01:55:52,199
To be independent.

1460
01:55:52,199 --> 01:55:53,466
I knew I had to be independent.

1461
01:55:53,466 --> 01:55:55,733
Isn't that kind of thing necessary?

1462
01:55:55,733 --> 01:55:57,666
I don't know, I just can't help it.

1463
01:55:57,666 --> 01:55:58,533
Now, when we get down to it.

1464
01:55:58,533 --> 01:56:00,333
It's all about economic rationality.

1465
01:56:00,333 --> 01:56:01,633
I'm going to go to extremes.

1466
01:56:01,633 --> 01:56:04,600
The balance between the two is very important.

1467
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:06,233
It's a balance.

1468
01:56:06,233 --> 01:56:08,066
Anything.

1469
01:56:08,066 --> 01:56:10,666
There are a lot of people who try to see things in terms of zero and one.

1470
01:56:10,666 --> 01:56:12,133
I get that a lot.

1471
01:56:12,133 --> 01:56:15,533
It's like volunteering or rewarding exploitation.

1472
01:56:15,533 --> 01:56:18,733
I don't know.

1473
01:56:18,733 --> 01:56:21,033
The rewards of work aren't just money.

1474
01:56:21,033 --> 01:56:23,033
I mean, it's obvious.

1475
01:56:23,033 --> 01:56:26,333
Of course, there's more than just this money.

1476
01:56:26,333 --> 01:56:27,866
Or growth.

1477
01:56:27,866 --> 01:56:29,800
Do that normal, creative thing.

1478
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:31,233
Or joy.

1479
01:56:31,233 --> 01:56:33,333
It's a combination of all these motivations.

1480
01:56:33,333 --> 01:56:35,366
People are on the move.

1481
01:56:35,366 --> 01:56:36,266
conversely speaking

1482
01:56:36,266 --> 01:56:38,300
Then you're supposed to pay for it.

1483
01:56:38,300 --> 01:56:40,566
You're not going to do it.

1484
01:56:40,566 --> 01:56:43,199
So that's where this job comes in.

1485
01:56:43,199 --> 01:56:44,733
Or ask for it.

1486
01:56:44,733 --> 01:56:46,733
And the person making the request.

1487
01:56:46,733 --> 01:56:49,500
Right now, it's about the other person.

1488
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:50,699
What is your motivation?

1489
01:56:50,699 --> 01:56:53,100
Like, are they moving me?

1490
01:56:53,100 --> 01:56:55,600
Well, you know, for what you did for me.

1491
01:56:55,600 --> 01:56:58,466
What can I do to show my appreciation?

1492
01:56:58,466 --> 01:57:04,000
The idea of the richness of a place like that...

1493
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
I'm just wondering if it's really necessary.

1494
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,033
You're going to pay for that.

1495
01:57:08,033 --> 01:57:09,600
The person making the request.

1496
01:57:09,600 --> 01:57:13,266
If that person is bound only by economic rationality.

1497
01:57:13,266 --> 01:57:16,800
Like, how much do you need?

1498
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:18,133
That's not what I meant.

1499
01:57:18,133 --> 01:57:21,433
That purpose was so much fun.

1500
01:57:21,433 --> 01:57:23,066
Everyone should be in on it.

1501
01:57:23,066 --> 01:57:24,933
If you want to make that thing.

1502
01:57:24,933 --> 01:57:27,133
You know, there are a lot of people who work with their hands.

1503
01:57:27,133 --> 01:57:28,399
Something about the Tokyo Metropolitan Government's website

1504
01:57:28,399 --> 01:57:31,100
There are a lot of people involved in this right now.

1505
01:57:31,100 --> 01:57:33,566
There are a lot of people who haven't paid that money.

1506
01:57:33,566 --> 01:57:35,333
But I'm not forcing you to do anything.

1507
01:57:35,333 --> 01:57:35,866
And it's not.

1508
01:57:35,866 --> 01:57:39,633
I'd like to thank you from the bottom of my heart.

1509
01:57:39,633 --> 01:57:41,300
It's really like this.

1510
01:57:41,300 --> 01:57:43,600
We're communicating with each other every day.

1511
01:57:43,600 --> 01:57:45,333
Well, that's something, isn't it?

1512
01:57:45,333 --> 01:57:47,333
It's going to take some doing.

1513
01:57:47,333 --> 01:57:50,366
So money is more than money to pay.

1514
01:57:50,366 --> 01:57:52,533
I've spent a lot of time and effort on it.

1515
01:57:52,533 --> 01:57:55,966
Well, someone who understands such things.

1516
01:57:55,966 --> 01:57:57,500
It's all good.

1517
01:57:57,500 --> 01:57:59,666
Some people are like that.

1518
01:57:59,666 --> 01:58:02,066
You'll have to pay for it.

1519
01:58:02,066 --> 01:58:04,466
That makes a difference, doesn't it?

1520
01:58:04,466 --> 01:58:07,000
That's the point.

1521
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:08,766
I wonder if it's necessary, like richness of mind.

1522
01:58:08,766 --> 01:58:11,366
I guess.

1523
01:58:11,366 --> 01:58:13,399
The state of Code for Japan

1524
01:58:13,399 --> 01:58:15,800
How long has it been since you've been to a place like this?

1525
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:17,066
Since we started up.

1526
01:58:17,066 --> 01:58:20,566
It was launched in October 2013?

1527
01:58:20,566 --> 01:58:22,366
It's been a little over seven years.

1528
01:58:22,366 --> 01:58:25,433
It's a bit more of a second phase.

1529
01:58:25,433 --> 01:58:26,666
I wonder if there was a second phase.

1530
01:58:26,666 --> 01:58:28,266
I think we're in phase three.

1531
01:58:28,266 --> 01:58:29,100
something around there

1532
01:58:29,100 --> 01:58:31,233
I think it's time for a change.

1533
01:58:31,233 --> 01:58:34,266
I was looking at it from the outside, too.

1534
01:58:34,266 --> 01:58:36,899
I think Code for Japan will be able to work together in this way.

1535
01:58:36,899 --> 01:58:37,666
Code fro Kyoto (Kyoto).

1536
01:58:37,666 --> 01:58:38,800
Or my day job.

1537
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:41,199
Maybe we can do some stuff.

1538
01:58:41,199 --> 01:58:42,533
There are many things that I think

1539
01:58:42,533 --> 01:58:44,333
I can see it in myself.

1540
01:58:44,333 --> 01:58:45,966
I don't know if that's what you're doing.

1541
01:58:45,966 --> 01:58:48,100
If you could just do something like this.

1542
01:58:48,100 --> 01:58:49,600
Maybe the cells will turn better.

1543
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:52,566
I've been seeing things like that myself.

1544
01:58:52,566 --> 01:58:55,600
Even from the representative, Mr. Seki, who is in the room.

1545
01:58:55,600 --> 01:58:58,000
I wonder if this is how things are going to change.

1546
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,766
I think there's something to be said for that.

1547
01:58:59,766 --> 01:59:02,066
I don't know how to make it more and more.

1548
01:59:02,066 --> 01:59:02,966
He wants to go like this.

1549
01:59:02,966 --> 01:59:07,300
I think that's what we're doing right now with the DIY cities we just talked about.

1550
01:59:07,300 --> 01:59:09,666
A little further down the road.

1551
01:59:09,666 --> 01:59:11,899
What can I do for you?

1552
01:59:11,899 --> 01:59:16,500
I knew it was something.

1553
01:59:16,500 --> 01:59:21,100
Once again, I was able to meet with people who are active in their respective areas.

1554
01:59:21,100 --> 01:59:24,566
I'd like to do something that involves collaboration.

1555
01:59:24,566 --> 01:59:25,666
I've been thinking.

1556
01:59:25,666 --> 01:59:28,333
Like the DIY city I mentioned earlier.

1557
01:59:28,333 --> 01:59:32,466
I'm trying to create a bottom-up society.

1558
01:59:32,466 --> 01:59:35,366
The country's assistant CIO.

1559
01:59:35,366 --> 01:59:38,433
I do a lot of that kind of work.

1560
01:59:38,433 --> 01:59:41,966
That's exactly what Japan is.

1561
01:59:41,966 --> 01:59:44,366
There are 1,741 municipalities.

1562
01:59:44,366 --> 01:59:46,066
I just think it's great.

1563
01:59:46,066 --> 01:59:50,600
How to make use of the diversity of it while

1564
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:53,633
Or create that better ecosystem.

1565
01:59:53,633 --> 01:59:54,733
Things like that are important.

1566
01:59:54,733 --> 01:59:55,866
I knew it was one of them.

1567
01:59:55,866 --> 01:59:59,266
You definitely need a local community.

1568
01:59:59,266 --> 02:00:03,933
In the past, it was more like a neighborhood association.

1569
02:00:03,933 --> 02:00:06,933
It's like that mutual aid community.

1570
02:00:06,933 --> 02:00:08,966
The part that's been holding us together.

1571
02:00:08,966 --> 02:00:10,466
This is how urbanization works.

1572
02:00:10,466 --> 02:00:14,366
But with urbanization and population decline

1573
02:00:14,366 --> 02:00:15,066
in that manner

1574
02:00:15,066 --> 02:00:16,566
It's gone.

1575
02:00:16,566 --> 02:00:19,166
And to be able to hold it together like this again.

1576
02:00:19,166 --> 02:00:21,800
I've always thought of it as this kind of civic tech community.

1577
02:00:21,800 --> 02:00:23,800
It's named after each region.

1578
02:00:23,800 --> 02:00:24,899
They say there's a community.

1579
02:00:24,899 --> 02:00:27,333
I think it's very important.

1580
02:00:27,333 --> 02:00:30,066
And Code for Japan.

1581
02:00:30,066 --> 02:00:32,399
What kind of relationship do we have?

1582
02:00:32,399 --> 02:00:34,266
It's like we're getting richer.

1583
02:00:34,266 --> 02:00:35,500
Win-win for both parties

1584
02:00:35,500 --> 02:00:37,866
Win-win is not the right word, it's something like this.

1585
02:00:37,866 --> 02:00:40,133
It's like we can lift each other up.

1586
02:00:40,133 --> 02:00:43,866
That's what I'm aiming for.

1587
02:00:43,866 --> 02:00:45,066
So there's that.

1588
02:00:45,066 --> 02:00:47,733
Code for Japan has been working on its

1589
02:00:47,733 --> 02:00:48,833
Or a base.

1590
02:00:48,833 --> 02:00:50,166
This is how the community works.

1591
02:00:50,166 --> 02:00:53,166
It's like a bridge between the two.

1592
02:00:53,166 --> 02:00:54,699
The people of each region

1593
02:00:54,699 --> 02:00:57,899
They say you can do what you really want to do.

1594
02:00:57,899 --> 02:00:59,566
That's the kind of environment we need.

1595
02:00:59,566 --> 02:01:01,866
I hope to make it in the next few years.

1596
02:01:01,866 --> 02:01:04,133
That's what I'm talking about.

1597
02:01:04,133 --> 02:01:04,899
Kyoto, for example.

1598
02:01:04,899 --> 02:01:08,600
Especially since we are not a town that communicates much to the outside world.

1599
02:01:08,600 --> 02:01:10,100
It's the Inner Circle.

1600
02:01:10,100 --> 02:01:12,533
There are so many community groups.

1601
02:01:12,533 --> 02:01:13,833
That's why we have to do it ourselves.

1602
02:01:13,833 --> 02:01:15,633
When we do Code for Kyoto.

1603
02:01:15,633 --> 02:01:19,199
I thought I had to make a difference.

1604
02:01:19,199 --> 02:01:19,566
So.

1605
02:01:19,566 --> 02:01:22,866
Code = source, because it's programming.

1606
02:01:22,866 --> 02:01:26,333
I heard that IT is going to change something like this.

1607
02:01:26,333 --> 02:01:29,133
It's important to write code properly.

1608
02:01:29,133 --> 02:01:31,833
That's what you said at first.

1609
02:01:31,833 --> 02:01:34,399
But I've been thinking it's getting different.

1610
02:01:34,399 --> 02:01:37,066
Something like that.

1611
02:01:37,066 --> 02:01:40,000
I can help you from the IT place.

1612
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:41,600
I've been talking to the local government.

1613
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:42,899
I've been through a lot myself.

1614
02:01:42,899 --> 02:01:44,199
Some of them I get for my work.

1615
02:01:44,199 --> 02:01:46,066
I was trying to get involved.

1616
02:01:46,066 --> 02:01:47,366
I don't know.

1617
02:01:47,366 --> 02:01:49,300
It's not there.

1618
02:01:49,300 --> 02:01:51,533
But I've also been working with other people in the community.

1619
02:01:51,533 --> 02:01:53,300
I knew it was different.

1620
02:01:53,300 --> 02:01:56,366
It's kind of IT-based.

1621
02:01:56,366 --> 02:01:58,100
When you say you're going to do it with IT, it's like...

1622
02:01:58,100 --> 02:01:59,566
Please create a facebook page.

1623
02:01:59,566 --> 02:02:01,933
Or something like that.

1624
02:02:01,933 --> 02:02:02,933
It's not like that.

1625
02:02:02,933 --> 02:02:05,133
I don't want to do those little things.

1626
02:02:05,133 --> 02:02:08,199
It's just something that happens.

1627
02:02:08,199 --> 02:02:10,066
There was a time when I didn't know what to think.

1628
02:02:10,066 --> 02:02:11,966
I have a much different perspective now.

1629
02:02:11,966 --> 02:02:14,866
I'm also thinking that it's not there.

1630
02:02:14,866 --> 02:02:16,399
That's pretty much everyone.

1631
02:02:16,399 --> 02:02:19,533
You say you're trying to figure out the value of what you do.

1632
02:02:19,533 --> 02:02:21,866
A national push for open data?

1633
02:02:21,866 --> 02:02:23,366
There are a lot of problems.

1634
02:02:23,366 --> 02:02:24,600
I think I'll do that.

1635
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:25,366
this way

1636
02:02:25,366 --> 02:02:28,966
That's what I'm saying, let's make use of it.

1637
02:02:28,966 --> 02:02:31,000
I don't know if I'd use it, but I'd have to get it out of my system.

1638
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:32,300
It's called "utilization.

1639
02:02:32,300 --> 02:02:34,466
I have to admit that I'm not sure how I feel about that.

1640
02:02:34,466 --> 02:02:37,133
But the fact that it's being used so much makes it all the more important.

1641
02:02:37,133 --> 02:02:39,500
How can I make it worthwhile?

1642
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:41,933
If anything, I'd like to know what's going on with the people at Civic Tech.

1643
02:02:41,933 --> 02:02:43,300
Maybe there's something to it.

1644
02:02:43,300 --> 02:02:46,666
The number of people who are like that has been increasing dramatically lately.

1645
02:02:46,666 --> 02:02:48,766
I get a lot of questions and inquiries about it.

1646
02:02:48,766 --> 02:02:51,666
How can I get an introduction to someone from Civic Tech?

1647
02:02:51,666 --> 02:02:54,333
I've seen a lot of things like that.

1648
02:02:54,333 --> 02:02:57,066
I also think this is a very good trend.

1649
02:02:57,066 --> 02:02:58,100
I was just thinking.

1650
02:02:58,100 --> 02:03:00,399
Something like us.

1651
02:03:00,399 --> 02:03:02,199
There are some places that do this in the community.

1652
02:03:02,199 --> 02:03:04,199
I'm sure it's going to change.

1653
02:03:04,199 --> 02:03:06,633
I think I'm at a very important turning point.

1654
02:03:06,633 --> 02:03:09,066
I'm sure it's some kind of code four.

1655
02:03:09,066 --> 02:03:10,433
People working in the community.

1656
02:03:10,433 --> 02:03:12,333
And the people who do it in this way.

1657
02:03:12,333 --> 02:03:14,233
I think that's what he's feeling.

1658
02:03:14,233 --> 02:03:16,566
I think that's a great idea.

1659
02:03:16,566 --> 02:03:20,533
You know, it's been pretty exciting in each of those areas lately.

1660
02:03:20,533 --> 02:03:21,566
It's called a brigade.

1661
02:03:21,566 --> 02:03:23,600
I'm looking at the code for each region.

1662
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:25,133
Pretty much that tech.

1663
02:03:25,133 --> 02:03:28,466
Someone who is not on the technology side.

1664
02:03:28,466 --> 02:03:30,633
I've been working on it.

1665
02:03:30,633 --> 02:03:33,100
I've been thinking that there's been quite an increase.

1666
02:03:33,100 --> 02:03:35,466
You know, the so-called

1667
02:03:35,466 --> 02:03:36,899
Someone who can use that technology.

1668
02:03:36,899 --> 02:03:39,466
I'm tempted to use technology.

1669
02:03:39,466 --> 02:03:40,500
If we do that from the beginning.

1670
02:03:40,500 --> 02:03:41,933
It's not going to work.

1671
02:03:41,933 --> 02:03:43,666
In my past activities.

1672
02:03:43,666 --> 02:03:45,166
He knows what he's doing.

1673
02:03:45,166 --> 02:03:46,800
You know what?

1674
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:48,733
That so-called...

1675
02:03:48,733 --> 02:03:51,566
When you have a drill, you want to use it.

1676
02:03:51,566 --> 02:03:52,699
But that's the hard part.

1677
02:03:52,699 --> 02:03:54,199
And it's not technology-driven.

1678
02:03:54,199 --> 02:03:55,800
You can't be issue-driven.

1679
02:03:55,800 --> 02:03:57,833
I mean, that's both places.

1680
02:03:57,833 --> 02:04:01,333
When I think of some business service.

1681
02:04:01,333 --> 02:04:02,699
Isn't this task-driven?

1682
02:04:02,699 --> 02:04:04,399
There is a challenge, though.

1683
02:04:04,399 --> 02:04:06,066
But if you go that way...

1684
02:04:06,066 --> 02:04:07,633
Really that way.

1685
02:04:07,633 --> 02:04:09,633
It's what I wanted to do.

1686
02:04:09,633 --> 02:04:10,966
So let's go technology-driven.

1687
02:04:10,966 --> 02:04:13,566
Then again, I'm not sure I'm solving the problem.

1688
02:04:13,566 --> 02:04:16,000
This is a difficult place.

1689
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,233
It's very important to move your hands.

1690
02:04:18,233 --> 02:04:20,000
In the process of prototyping

1691
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:21,466
I'm seeing a lot of things.

1692
02:04:21,466 --> 02:04:23,266
I'm going to throw that away to some extent.

1693
02:04:23,266 --> 02:04:25,533
And you have to have the courage to say.

1694
02:04:25,533 --> 02:04:27,866
I've been working on this for a long time.

1695
02:04:27,866 --> 02:04:29,199
I've been in a lot of meetings.

1696
02:04:29,199 --> 02:04:30,699
I can't make any progress.

1697
02:04:30,699 --> 02:04:32,500
The answer to that question is two wheels.

1698
02:04:32,500 --> 02:04:33,699
I need it.

1699
02:04:33,699 --> 02:04:35,766
The technology side is already becoming a commodity.

1700
02:04:35,766 --> 02:04:38,766
Use that real low coding tool.

1701
02:04:38,766 --> 02:04:39,933
Quickly, is this what you mean?

1702
02:04:39,933 --> 02:04:41,966
You can do something like that.

1703
02:04:41,966 --> 02:04:44,699
Engineers can work in the next phase.

1704
02:04:44,699 --> 02:04:47,133
The first part of what you have to do is

1705
02:04:47,133 --> 02:04:49,000
The techs are a little quiet.

1706
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:50,899
I think it would be better if it was more like that.

1707
02:04:50,899 --> 02:04:53,266
I will, though.

1708
02:04:53,266 --> 02:04:54,433
I caught a glimpse of it earlier.

1709
02:04:54,433 --> 02:04:56,866
The government's assistant CIO, for example.

1710
02:04:56,866 --> 02:04:58,166
It's been done.

1711
02:04:58,166 --> 02:05:00,033
There's a lot of bottom-up stuff going on here.

1712
02:05:00,033 --> 02:05:01,833
I'd like to talk about community activities.

1713
02:05:01,833 --> 02:05:03,266
In support.

1714
02:05:03,266 --> 02:05:03,833
Now the country's

1715
02:05:03,833 --> 02:05:05,666
You do that kind of work, too.

1716
02:05:05,666 --> 02:05:07,633
Something there.

1717
02:05:07,633 --> 02:05:09,366
Is there any difference in Seki-san's mind?

1718
02:05:09,366 --> 02:05:11,633
Or is there some kind of continuation there?

1719
02:05:11,633 --> 02:05:14,533
It's something I've been working on.

1720
02:05:14,533 --> 02:05:16,033
That's going on.

1721
02:05:16,033 --> 02:05:17,666
I'm...

1722
02:05:17,666 --> 02:05:18,933
From the rather early days.

1723
02:05:18,933 --> 02:05:23,566
I have a strategy of using multiple job titles.

1724
02:05:23,566 --> 02:05:26,266
That makes sense.

1725
02:05:26,266 --> 02:05:29,800
I thought you said you had a lot of business cards.

1726
02:05:29,800 --> 02:05:31,666
You've got all kinds of hats.

1727
02:05:31,666 --> 02:05:33,000
It's very convenient.

1728
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:36,600
Only in that country.

1729
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:39,133
Only in the capacity of assistant to the national CIO.

1730
02:05:39,133 --> 02:05:41,399
There's some information you can't get.

1731
02:05:41,399 --> 02:05:44,033
You can see it only when you're inside.

1732
02:05:44,033 --> 02:05:46,533
I understand that it's a structural issue.

1733
02:05:46,533 --> 02:05:49,466
The more you know about it, the better.

1734
02:05:49,466 --> 02:05:52,266
It makes it easier to make suggestions.

1735
02:05:52,266 --> 02:05:56,199
So it'll be easier for us to work together.

1736
02:05:56,199 --> 02:05:57,000
in that sense

1737
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:01,266
I'm really the assistant CIO of the country.

1738
02:06:01,266 --> 02:06:01,833
A small place.

1739
02:06:01,833 --> 02:06:04,833
In a place called Nishiawakura Village with a population of 1,400.

1740
02:06:04,833 --> 02:06:06,666
I'm also doing CIO.

1741
02:06:06,666 --> 02:06:10,266
It's just a matter of broadening your horizons.

1742
02:06:10,266 --> 02:06:11,166
From various layers

1743
02:06:11,166 --> 02:06:13,166
I'm just trying to be someone who can see things.

1744
02:06:13,166 --> 02:06:14,166
Just do it.

1745
02:06:14,166 --> 02:06:16,699
It's a continuation of the earth in that sense.

1746
02:06:16,699 --> 02:06:19,866
Sometimes I'll give my opinion as a technician.

1747
02:06:19,866 --> 02:06:21,533
Sometimes it's really like this.

1748
02:06:21,533 --> 02:06:26,066
With a certain amount of consideration for the feelings of the bureaucracy.

1749
02:06:26,066 --> 02:06:27,899
For example, criticism.

1750
02:06:27,899 --> 02:06:30,000
That's a fair criticism.

1751
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,466
It's probably counterproductive to talk about it that way.

1752
02:06:32,466 --> 02:06:34,800
It's the same.

1753
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:35,833
How would I know?

1754
02:06:35,833 --> 02:06:37,866
for that reason

1755
02:06:37,866 --> 02:06:40,366
I've been in many positions.

1756
02:06:40,366 --> 02:06:42,800
In that sense, it's a continuation of the ground.

1757
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:44,800
as Seki.

1758
02:06:44,800 --> 02:06:46,899
What do you want to do in the future?

1759
02:06:46,899 --> 02:06:48,466
Something like that at the end.

1760
02:06:48,466 --> 02:06:50,800
Would you mind telling me?

1761
02:06:50,800 --> 02:06:52,566
I am.

1762
02:06:52,566 --> 02:06:55,166
I want to quit Code for Japan as soon as possible.

1763
02:06:55,166 --> 02:06:56,666
Oh, I see.

1764
02:06:56,666 --> 02:07:01,600
One more "Seki, I'm quitting" on the web.

1765
02:07:01,600 --> 02:07:09,633
I'll flush it.

1766
02:07:09,633 --> 02:07:12,233
It's not like I'm quitting next month yet.

1767
02:07:12,233 --> 02:07:15,933
It's like everyone is here to declare their resignation.

1768
02:07:15,933 --> 02:07:18,600
Yeah.

1769
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:20,333
I'm not quitting yet.

1770
02:07:20,333 --> 02:07:24,966
I'm just thinking about the generational change.

1771
02:07:24,966 --> 02:07:27,300
I'm old enough to know better.

1772
02:07:27,300 --> 02:07:30,633
After all, it's like Civic Tech.

1773
02:07:30,633 --> 02:07:31,666
Especially.

1774
02:07:31,666 --> 02:07:33,466
We should pass it on to the next generation as soon as possible.

1775
02:07:33,466 --> 02:07:35,666
That's what I'm thinking.

1776
02:07:35,666 --> 02:07:39,199
Innovation is...

1777
02:07:39,199 --> 02:07:43,133
Something like that is built on generational change.

1778
02:07:43,133 --> 02:07:44,433
I have a

1779
02:07:44,433 --> 02:07:46,500
I knew it.

1780
02:07:46,500 --> 02:07:48,033
A lot of really young people since last year.

1781
02:07:48,033 --> 02:07:49,433
I've been working with Code for Japan.

1782
02:07:49,433 --> 02:07:51,300
Yes, it's a huge increase.

1783
02:07:51,300 --> 02:07:53,166
He's very good.

1784
02:07:53,166 --> 02:07:54,266
Oh, my God.

1785
02:07:54,266 --> 02:07:57,666
It's like a natural way of thinking about civic tech.

1786
02:07:57,666 --> 02:07:59,633
It's ingrained in you.

1787
02:07:59,633 --> 02:08:01,399
And so those generations in

1788
02:08:01,399 --> 02:08:03,399
I should be the star of the show.

1789
02:08:03,399 --> 02:08:05,699
That generation.

1790
02:08:05,699 --> 02:08:08,966
Then when I said I wanted to do something...

1791
02:08:08,966 --> 02:08:10,433
At that time.

1792
02:08:10,433 --> 02:08:14,133
I just want to make sure that the environment is in place.

1793
02:08:14,133 --> 02:08:17,066
Then I could quit, I thought.

1794
02:08:17,066 --> 02:08:19,766
That's as soon as possible.

1795
02:08:19,766 --> 02:08:21,866
Make that happen.

1796
02:08:21,866 --> 02:08:23,433
I'm something different.

1797
02:08:23,433 --> 02:08:25,333
I'd like to do that.

1798
02:08:25,333 --> 02:08:27,300
I have a feeling this is just the beginning.

1799
02:08:27,300 --> 02:08:28,300
Always.

1800
02:08:28,300 --> 02:08:30,133
Geomedia is no different.

1801
02:08:30,133 --> 02:08:31,000
I think it's just the beginning.

1802
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
You're looking at a lot of different things then.

1803
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:34,399
Not for me, anyway.

1804
02:08:34,399 --> 02:08:36,766
I'm not good at growing that organization.

1805
02:08:36,766 --> 02:08:38,800
It's your personality.

1806
02:08:38,800 --> 02:08:42,566
It's amazing what happens when you start from scratch.

1807
02:08:42,566 --> 02:08:43,500
The World

1808
02:08:43,500 --> 02:08:45,633
But when I look at young people now, it's true.

1809
02:08:45,633 --> 02:08:46,966
What is Civic Tech?

1810
02:08:46,966 --> 02:08:48,266
You don't have to say.

1811
02:08:48,266 --> 02:08:49,866
I'm trying to do something.

1812
02:08:49,866 --> 02:08:50,866
It's a normal thing.

1813
02:08:50,866 --> 02:08:53,600
I really feel that.

1814
02:08:53,600 --> 02:08:54,699
Yes, sir.

1815
02:08:54,699 --> 02:08:55,633
Come on.

1816
02:08:55,633 --> 02:08:57,366
When I saw "Seki, I'm quitting.

1817
02:08:57,366 --> 02:08:58,566
Please tell me in secret.

1818
02:08:58,566 --> 02:09:01,333
I'll broadcast it to everyone.

1819
02:09:01,333 --> 02:09:05,199
Thank you very much.
